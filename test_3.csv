,"So I know this is a late response to this thread but I hope some people see this.

Reddit is for the most part not a great place for non-bias sources, as you can probably tell it is VERY bias towards a democrat viewpoint. Which I believe for the most part, is actually very logical. Most of the general viewpoints are realistic and good, but the specific information written in a headline as a hyperbole because of the bias. Imo this is actually pretty good, especially because it's scientifically backed. Because of this it makes people who were on the fence (much like myself and many others I know) about voting much clearer. But because of this going to Reddit for world news (specifically climate change) is the equivalent of using WebMD to diagnose yourself. There is a lot of truth on there, but all you are going to do is make yourself more anxious by looking at it. What I recommend is looking up reputable sources even if a little bias (BBC, IPCC, etc..) if you are really interested. Do what you can to help and vote for who will help the situation but don't let yourself get caught up in the ""mad max in 30 years"" scenario. These scenarios are based on a worst case scenario (and even then its fishy asf) where we don't use technology to help what we have and also assumes we burn the maximum amount of fuels. As the U.S. and other countries make transitions to cleaner energy other developing countries will still be using coal and fuels. It is very likely we will not phase all fuels out in time, but we are also developing technology to help it out. All that's left is for us to vote and stick it to the people who are against green policies. As long as you do what you can rest assured worst case scenarios will be avoided (assuming nothing absolutely crazy irrational happens.) And I'm not saying this to make you complacent, I URGE you to make strides not only to improve yourselves but the world for us and the next generation. Humanity has so much potential, anyone saying it's already lost is lying to themselves. Hopefully I helped someone out with this, I struggled with this for the past 2 or 3 weeks.

As a recap I came to terms with it by realizing that:

A: We aren't in a worst case scenario, and the methane permafrost loop has debunked multiple times and is only accepted by very few scientists. Even if it were it's solvable.

B: As much as people claim bullshit on this statement it's true, as humans we have the ability to adapt to an EXTRAORDINARY amount of circumstances. We can and will adapt. However if we want to live in a future similar to today,  we NEED to take action as soon as humanly possible. Get climate change skeptics and deniers out of office, do what you can yourself to improve your life and make the changes you want to see in the world. Also the more you help YOUR community the better your area will be if worst comes to worst.

C: This is just general life advice but live your best life. You can do so being as green as possible but *live your best life*. Find love. Have children, teach them the importance of life and how to learn from past mistakes. Find something you love and whole heartily enjoy doing. Unless aging is cured or somehow the singularity pops we are all on a limited lifespan. The universe is vast and whether heaven or hell, or nothing at all if you live your best life, you've done everything you can.

,"climate change isn't just going to pop up and murder people, you're going to have a long period of economic decline where people get really really unhappy and that's probably where you will see the greatest chance to make large gains in the big ideas to combat climate change.

I'll say it again and time will prove me right, reduction is not going to be enough to stop a couple billion people from dying. you need to take active measures which effectively include offsetting the geoengineering of 7.7 billion people living on the planet with some type of geoengineering that helps keep earth's climate in check.

there really isn't a natural solution scenario here, climate is not that stable. Humans developed in a window of an ice age and cooling trend and much of the planet's history is quite the opposite.

So, even the most ardent environmentalist needs to admit that this climate that were all used to is destined to change and essentially murder most of humanity. Sure, maybe it wasn't going to happen for another 10 million years, but that was then and this is now. The natural course has been interrupted and it's going to take an artificial effort to correct it beyond out of just reduction.

Even the natural cycle of 80,000 years of cooling in 20,000 years of warming is not something that humanity would be able to come anywhere near surviving at today's population levels.

If you embrace the idea that we can just reduce and let nature fix things, you're still embracing reduction of human population as one of your primary solutions. since we're going to need technology to keep this planet's climate anywhere near the threshold that humans are used to over the last ten thousand years, I think everyone just needs to get used to the idea that we're going to have to actively tweak the climate well beyond that of what nature would do because at the end of the day nature's big plan is to eventually make humans go extinct.

In the more short-term model the predictions of massive economic decline caused by global climate change as well as billions of people's lives being put at risk is also a good reason to not put all our eggs in the greenhouse gas reduction basket unless of course you're okay with the inevitability of billions of people dying as part of your solution.

We're going to have to actively attack CO2 and methane and pull it out of the atmosphere and perhaps even block solar insolation from adding so much heat to the planet. 

In 50 years or so we're going to be at a catastrophic level of climate change that causes massive economic decline and global instability and almost certainly world war and that's only about 50 years away.

I don't believe even if we met reduction goals tomorrow that we would stop rising temperatures from releasing even more methane over the next few decades and then you're going to have to face that temperature spike and essentially unknown amounts of methane release and damag ecosystems.

The biggest climate threat of CO2 is that it's going to release the methane stores which will have a far more profound and rapid impact than just co2. So, the problem will become exponentially worse and that's why I taking extreme measures is going to become the more and more obvious option.

I'm sorry we're going to have to geoengineer the planet, but technically we already did when we build all these houses and roads and farms. All I'm really saying is you're going to have to geoengineer your geoengineering. 

I've been getting downvoted for like a decade for saying this. Convincing that many people and that many nations to meet reduction goals is probably actually a much more difficult goal than just engineering CO2 and methane and ocean acidification down to levels that we can deal with. And yes, as ridiculous as it sounds blocking out the sun a little bit is going to become a more and more practical idea. it's not nearly as bad as it sounds and volcano is essentially naturally do it all the time, but it clearly still has to be coupled with reduction and that should go without saying if your scientifically minded enough to even understand this post.

I'm disappointed about how many supposed environmentalists and climate change activists don't want to hear anything but reduction and minimalism. to me it seems like you're dragging your feet and risking billions of people's lies. Even back in 1980 you were probably inevitably on this path where you needed technological solutions to manage the climate beyond just reduction, because the world's a big place with a lot of developing nations and they're all going to go through intense periods of pollution. 

We're still barely focused on agricultural pollution and very much obsessed with fossil fuel pollution and that's not really the full spectrum solution that you would need even if bet everything on reduction. You've been able to cut back your meat consumption for decades and have far more impact than buying an electric car or solar panels, but what percentage of progressive liberals have given up meat? You need to listen to the scientists and not just the journalist!

,"Basically humanity will survive and adapt. As far as I’m aware the IPCC isn’t projecting billions of deaths from weather disasters. The details can be read below. All of there summaries of the data are presented in a way that isn’t sensationalized and they indicate how confident they are in their predictions. 

News media and to an extent advocacy groups are incentivized to take scenarios that are unlikely and speculate about them wildly. So it’s best for everyone’s mental health to ignore those apocalypse mongers. 

There are all sort of things that can wreck humanity: coronal mass ejections, asteroid events, large volcanic eruptions, etc. Biology misbehaving itself and another pandemic is also a threat. The good news is that climate change isn’t one that is likely to take us by surprise.

What’s also important is that we can’t put all our eggs in one apocalyptic basket. We should still track asteroids and study volcanism. We can upgrade our grid to be more robust again solar events. We need to continue to monitor changes in pathogens and novel diseases in people. Establishing a self sustaining population on Mars seems an eminently reasonable insurance policy. 

We live in an interesting time full of great advancements and unique threats. We happen to live in the most peaceful time in history. We are hardwired to look for threats and the historically visceral (predators, warring tribes, injury, securing food and water) have been replaced (in developed countries and some developing countries) with threats in the abstract. I think the best thing to do psychologically is to circumscribe their magnitude with self-education and an eye toward what we are able to do as individuals. That way we aren’t haunted by fear but empowered with knowledge and prudence.

,"Reformed believer, now skeptic. Here are my reasons for changing my beliefs.

Based on IPCC, non-controversial theory of CC / CAGW. The following 3 points are fundamental to the science, as opposed to melting ice or whatever, which points are evidentiary supports, but not proof of man-created anything or CO2 causing anything, just evidence of likely temp increase.

1. CO2 has been 10 X higher in the past - above 4000ppm without any runaway effects.
2. The correlation between temperature change and CO2 increase (as per Gore’s graph) is real, but the time is backwards. Temp rises about 800 - 1000 years before CO2. This is the most basic principle, in fact, the mean ing of science altogether (except quantum): Cause precedes Effect. Gore’s graph essentially disproves the correct causal flow of CO2 → Temperature Rise. But he didn’t tell his audience that, unfortunately.
3. Warming is asymptotic, according to the theory. (technically logarithmic, but the result is essentially identical and asymptotic is easier to explain). This means that increases in CO2 lead to a maximum limit of temperature change, which most believers in the theory set between 1.5 - 2.5 C. The normal temp range of the planet for the past few million years is about 6C colder to 4 C higher than current, so an increase of 2.5 is non-problematic. However, the theory claims that this warming will now release enormous amounts of methane. Why it didn’t happen with warmer past temperatures has not been properly explained.
4. Bonus - the consensus has been refuted by a group of CC scientists at the IPCC. Search for the report and you will see that the IPCC itself has refuted the so-called consensus.",Reformed believer now skeptic Here are my reasons for changing my beliefs Based on IPCC noncontroversial theory of CC CAGW The following points are fundamental to the science as opposed to melting ice or whatever which points are evidentiary supports but not proof of mancreated anything or CO causing anything just evidence of likely temp increase CO has been X higher in the past above ppm without any runaway effects The correlation between temperature change and CO increase as per Gores graph is real but the time is backwards Temp rises about years before CO This is the most basic principle in fact the mean ing of science altogether except quantum Cause precedes Effect Gores graph essentially disproves the correct causal flow of CO Temperature Rise But he didnt tell his audience that unfortunately Warming is asymptotic according to the theory technically logarithmic but the result is essentially identical and asymptotic is easier to explain This means that increases in CO lead to a maximum limit of temperature change which most believers in the theory set between C The normal temp range of the planet for the past few million years is about C colder to C higher than current so an increase of is nonproblematic However the theory claims that this warming will now release enormous amounts of methane Why it didnt happen with warmer past temperatures has not been properly explained Bonus the consensus has been refuted by a group of CC scientists at the IPCC Search for the report and you will see that the IPCC itself has refuted the socalled consensus,265,report cc correct scientists ice changing ing see million reformed co gores normal principle increase rises increases cagw temp altogether melting amounts believers consensus nonproblematic mean effect result evidentiary quantum reasons runaway limit noncontroversial temperatures precedes except range causing claims effects time based identical group however warmer per rise fundamental mancreated cause properly points temperature opposed supports set refuted believer science anything past x ppm search fact according skeptic technically enormous likely colder c flow whatever causal asymptotic ipcc maximum release means change evidence easier without planet essentially backwards years higher proof real logarithmic audience happen following warming didnt unfortunately theory correlation methane basic socalled explained tell lead current beliefs graph explain disproves bonus
,"A few years ago the World Health Organization published an estimate that Climate Change currently kills 115,000 people a year.

Compare this with the annual number of deaths caused around the world by car accidents-1.2 million.

A (very) rough estimate of the number of deaths from all causes of death each year would be (1/70)*7.5 Billion=~107 Million.

So your probability of dying today from Climate Change is roughly 1 in a Thousand.

,"I will explain Why human-induced Global Warming or Climate change is impossible or absurd. Doing so even the real ignorant will understand why. I am sure no one can refute it. If anyone refutes this, I will leave the earth.  
  
First of all, do you know how much carbon dioxide makes up in the atmosphere? I have not seen any greenie who know this fact. It makes up just 0.03% or 3/10,000. In other words, it is an amount that is almost non-existent. More importantly, more than 96% of it is a naturally occurring amount. This is not the miss print in that 96 % is correct.  
  
It is common knowledge among the educated people that if carbon dioxide itself does not exist, like oxygen, the earth will perish, but some idiots such as Greenies keep saying it is pollutant.  
  
Earth science has shown that before the advent of humans, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was sometimes many times higher than it is today. So, what it means is that a huge amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in swamps and seas was released for some reason. Why were they released? They were released because of Global Warming. That is, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a result or effect of Global Warming not the cause of it  
  
In the meantime, humans are now emitting the result or effect of Global Warming not the cause of it. Even that amount is the tiny portion of a naturally occurring amount.  
  
In summary, human is emitting the effect of Global Warming not the cause of it. So how can humans induce Global Warming or Climate Change? It is impossible as we are emitting effect not cause.  
  
I proved why human cannot induce Global Warming or Climate Change in such a way that even the most retarded person can understand why. However, there will be definitely idiots who don't understand.

,"Hey everybody I can prove that man-made climate change does not exist in five minutes. Go out on the Internet and pull up a chart showing atmospheric gases. What you’ll find is a list of nine gases or list of 16 gases. For simplicity sake will use the non-gas charts. Most abundant gas in our atmosphere is nitrogen it makes app 78% of our atmosphere. The next most abundant gas is what all life on earth depends on oxygen it makes up 21% of our atmosphere. So of the nine gas is two of them Make up 99% of the gases in our atmosphere. You only have 1% left and there are 7 different gases in that One percent. The next most abundant gas is called argon and it makes up 93% of that 1%. Then comes that gas that nobody likes CO2 you know the one that all plants cannot survive without. There’s only .07% left of the entire 100% and there are six more gases in that .07%. CO2 makes up half of that or .035%. I’ve read where scientist think that the world produces 600 billion tons of CO2 on its own each year and humans produce 3% of that or 18 billion tons of CO2. So now I’m gonna give you two analogies, you got a football stadium that holds 100,000 people in it and each person represents a gas in our atmosphere. 78,000 would be nitrogen 21,000 would be oxygen 930 would be argon and 35 would be CO2 and man makes 3% of 35 which is one.

,"Climate is basically defined by trends across 30 year periods (as few as 10 in some instances). In terms of things that can kill you, natural disasters, specifically weather events and wildlife’s are things that come to mind. You cannot and should not attribute any individual weather event or fire to climate change. What predicts getting killed by such an event is poverty. If you live in Haiti then you simply won’t fair well if a hurricane hits you, if you live in Florida then you live in a place with the infrastructure and means to get to safety. In terms of roasting alive my understanding of the trends in global temperatures is that highest highs aren’t increasing but the lowest lows are, so as of now the climate has been trending toward being more mild, where the difference between the highest high and lowest lows are less not more. 

The sea is rising, and has been for the last century (well actually since the end of the last ice age), at something like 2-4 mm a year. So it’s not something that is happening all at once. 

The economy globally is not projected to collapse, crops are unlikely to fail. 

That being said, the debate lies on how much we need to reduce emissions while not crippling the development of the poorest countries because poverty is the biggest thing that puts people at risk.

Leaked Draft IPCC Report Warns Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Must Peak in Four Years

COP26: Document leak reveals nations lobbying to change key climate report


In 2009 it was estimated that we could pump 560 gigatons into the atmosphere before we cause a irreversible 2.0°C meltdown.

We have since pumped out 416 gigatons.
We essentially have 4 years of that budget left worth of hydrocarbons we can pump out.

The problem is we litteraly need to electrify everything and put out 3x our current peak supply of 19 TWatts in order to stave off complete collapse and do it in 4 years.

Thats sinply not going to happen.
Notice i didn't say not possible...its just not going to happen.

For the same reason as the effects of climate change are way worse than even the IPCC is openly admitting; while they are still trying to down play it.",Leaked Draft IPCC Report Warns Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Must Peak in Four Years COP Document leak reveals nations lobbying to change key climate report In it was estimated that we could pump gigatons into the atmosphere before we cause a irreversible C meltdown We have since pumped out gigatons We essentially have years of that budget left worth of hydrocarbons we can pump out The problem is we litteraly need to electrify everything and put out x our current peak supply of TWatts in order to stave off complete collapse and do it in years Thats sinply not going to happen Notice i didnt say not possibleits just not going to happen For the same reason as the effects of climate change are way worse than even the IPCC is openly admitting while they are still trying to down play it,142,warns report must reason hydrocarbons even supply happen cop left need worse say play since meltdown twatts x leaked atmosphere key sinply stave didnt still nations everything effects notice lobbying four document possibleits gas emissions put reveals problem worth collapse draft peak gigatons c essentially thats could litteraly estimated openly current ipcc climate pump way electrify complete admitting pumped cause global order going change greenhouse budget trying irreversible leak years

Pollution being of concern we will see major health problems as politicians ignore the impacts of pollution in favor of the economy. Farming has already changed due to climate change. Because of acid rain farmers have to use anti-fungal applications on crops, acid rain makes the soil more acidic and acid soil causes fungus to thrive. Our ecosystem requires a delicate balance.

,"Improper or lack of waste management is one of the major reasons for pollution and is also contributing to global warming. There is a need for proper waste collection and disposal system in the rural and neglected areas.  
A continent of over 1.3 billion people, most countries in Africa lack proper waste management systems. As per a 2018 report published by the United Nations Environment Program, the total waste generated in Africa was 125 million tons in 2012, which is expected to double by 2025. The total waste collection rate is 55% out of which almost 90% is disposed of at uncontrolled dumpsites and landfills where there are also recorded instances of open burning. The sub-Saharan region is home to some of the largest dumpsites in the world. Out of the total waste generated, almost 13% is plastic and 57% is organic waste. Almost 80% of the waste generated in this region is recyclable and currently only 4% is being recycled.  
The project proposes to start small waste collection centers in backward and rural areas where there is little or no waste collection system.  
Proper waste disposal means no garbage being exposed to the environment. No direct sunlight exposure to the plastic means no harmful gases are being released to the environment.   
We are raising funds to start these centres in Africa.

When I was of school age I felt the exact same way as you, and what was worse was that back then people weren't even talking much about climate change in everyday life despite the science being clear.

Considering that the public awareness is now greater than ever, I think the next decade could very well represent a turning point whereby our governments finally accept the urgency of the global climate situation. If we are to achieve this we must stay positive and not fall into despair.

Ultimately no one can say for sure how things are going to play out over the course of your lifetime. We may end up doing just fine, or things could be worse than we expected. Young people that grew up during the Cold War era felt a similar sense of dread that you and many others do today.

," 

>97% of scientists think that humans are 50% or more of the cause of climate change, **a modest 0.8 degrees since 1880.**

Nonsense

>• The likely range of the human contribution to the global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2010 is 1.1° to 1.4°F (0.6° to 0.8°C), and the central estimate of the observed warming of 1.2°F (0.65°C) lies within this range (high confidence). This translates to a likely human contribution of 92%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 change. The likely contributions of natural forcing and internal variability to global temperature change over that period are minor (high confidence). (Ch. 3; Fig. ES.2)  
[https://science2017.globalchange.gov/downloads/CSSR2017\_FullReport.pdf](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/downloads/CSSR2017_FullReport.pdf)

And as for the temperature it is currently

>Global temperatures in 2018 were 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.83 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1951 to 1980 mean, according to scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. Globally, 2018's temperatures rank behind those of 2016, 2017 and 2015. The past five years are, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record.

[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/2018-fourth-warmest-year-in-continued-warming-trend-according-to-nasa-noaa](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/2018-fourth-warmest-year-in-continued-warming-trend-according-to-nasa-noaa)

So it is 0.8C warmer than the 1950-1980 average not 0.8C warmer than 1880.

I suggest you stick to articles written by people who know what they are talking about rather than drivel manufactured by someone who has no apparent background in any physical science.

This article is just junk.

>Warmer temperatures in the 1200s were a boon to the global economy.

That's incorrect. The fact is that there is a great deal of debate about climate sensitivity. There are credible papers suggesting that equilibrium climate sensitivity (meaning the eventual temperature rise for a doubling of atmospheric CO2) is less than 2.0°C, and we haven't doubled since preindustrial times.

Claiming that the climate is not in a catastrophic state doesn’t mean that somebody doesn’t believe that mitigation efforts shouldn’t be made. In fact most scientists that are claiming that the politicians who use climate change as a method of scaring people into voting for them also believe that humans must adapt in order to prevent any runaway events. The politicians think they have the answers, almost scientists think that humans are capable of adapting and surviving and that those politicians are being dishonest (shocking I know).

,"Here's the thing, the world adapts, and so do humans and technology. That's part of evolution, and natural selection. There is technology today that make things possible, that were not 20 years ago. Increasing efficiency in agriculture for example, that 20 years ago, people thought it was going to be a lot worse, but we adapted.

I've been through this before, and have studied the history of this, going back decades. Here are just a few failed doomsday climate predictions. AOCs 12 years to the world ends, is just the same nonsense.

I used to buy into this, but as I get older, and see the same groups saying if we don't act now the sky falls, it's nothing but chicken littles. Then you really have to do the research to find out who benefits from all of this, and you will see how high this actually goes. It's about control.

The 2005 UNEP predictions claimed that, by 2010, some 50 million “climate refugees” would be frantically fleeing from the Caribbean and low-lying Pacific islands. None of it occurred.

The UN climate science panel also said in 2007 Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 or sooner. And then quickly removed it from the report after it was determined that no science at all went into the prediction.

The 2003 Pentagon document, entitled An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security, stated that polar ice all gone, parts of California under water, parts of Europe underwater. Another lie from climate scientists.

Global cooling “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but 11 degrees colder by the year 2000,” claimed ecology professor Kenneth E.F. Watt at the University of California in 1970.

“By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people,” because of a global ice age said Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich.",Heres the thing the world adapts and so do humans and technology Thats part of evolution and natural selection There is technology today that make things possible that were not years ago Increasing efficiency in agriculture for example that years ago people thought it was going to be a lot worse but we adapted Ive been through this before and have studied the history of this going back decades Here are just a few failed doomsday climate predictions AOCs years to the world ends is just the same nonsense I used to buy into this but as I get older and see the same groups saying if we dont act now the sky falls its nothing but chicken littles Then you really have to do the research to find out who benefits from all of this and you will see how high this actually goes Its about control The UNEP predictions claimed that by some million climate refugees would be frantically fleeing from the Caribbean and lowlying Pacific islands None of it occurred The UN climate science panel also said in Himalayan glaciers could melt by or sooner And then quickly removed it from the report after it was determined that no science at all went into the prediction The Pentagon document entitled An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security stated that polar ice all gone parts of California under water parts of Europe underwater Another lie from climate scientists Global cooling If present trends continue the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in but degrees colder by the year claimed ecology professor Kenneth EF Watt at the University of California in By the year the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands inhabited by some million hungry people because of a global ice age said Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich,317,went ehrlich research report scenario lot national panel failed scientists kingdom aocs ice himalayan california un continue year claimed see million watt make ends adapts part natural implications trends university thats stanford groups climate sooner dont ef states evolution older mean also people control another humans technology high thing refugees doomsday present stated europe parts united world falls fleeing group simply degrees could things chicken history removed saying benefits islands would going frantically temperature entitled kenneth pacific melt agriculture find science ive quickly thought ecology cooling glaciers none lowlying age four pentagon prediction littles colder gone paul ago possible example really unep water lie global abrupt change studied years nonsense inhabited decades underwater said actually predictions determined worse nothing polar security act hungry document increasing today get small back heres goes buy efficiency used professor impoverished occurred selection caribbean adapted sky

The estimates for Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity changed from 3.2 °C to 3.7 °C and the estimates for the Transient climate response from 1.8 °C, to 2.0 °C. That is probably because of better understanding of the role of clouds and aerosols.[64]

,"But what if the models are accurate? Are you willing to bet hundreds of millions of human lives that the models are wrong and that everything is going to be OK?

,"Can you please share your sources on hurricane statistics and sun’s impact on climate?

To respond to a couple of your points:
Here is a handy video showing wildfires since 1900: https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/05/video-100-years-of-california-wildfires-in-2-minutes/

You will notice there are zero that are as large as the ones in recent years, and far more happening now.

Regarding the polar vortex- extreme weather events are actually a result of average global temperature rise. Temperatures don’t go up uniformly across the world. Some places get colder. Most get warmer. Hence average global temperature.

As for kelp and coral, I work with an organization that is helping restore both. How are they doing it? By bringing up cold water from the deep parts of the ocean to cool the surrounding water. Guess what? It’s working. Meaning heat is a huge factor in the die off.

It is true that there are natural fluctuations in climate, and within that range, warmer is better. However, we are heading for average temperatures that are equivalent to previous mass extinction events that occurred long before humans existed.

One other question - why is it so hard to believe in the greenhouse effect? We have literal greenhouses that do exactly what’s happening to our climate. On a sunny day, is it hotter outside or inside the space that is trapping the incoming energy from the sun?

And your point about it being possible to control pollution is absolutely correct. We need to stop both plastic pollution and air pollution from fossil fuels. That pollution is what is having such a severe impact on the climate.

Also, side note: How were medieval times prosperous?",Can you please share your sources on hurricane statistics and suns impact on climate To respond to a couple of your points Here is a handy video showing wildfires since You will notice there are zero that are as large as the ones in recent years and far more happening now Regarding the polar vortex extreme weather events are actually a result of average global temperature rise Temperatures dont go up uniformly across the world Some places get colder Most get warmer Hence average global temperature As for kelp and coral I work with an organization that is helping restore both How are they doing it By bringing up cold water from the deep parts of the ocean to cool the surrounding water Guess what Its working Meaning heat is a huge factor in the die off It is true that there are natural fluctuations in climate and within that range warmer is better However we are heading for average temperatures that are equivalent to previous mass extinction events that occurred long before humans existed One other question why is it so hard to believe in the greenhouse effect We have literal greenhouses that do exactly whats happening to our climate On a sunny day is it hotter outside or inside the space that is trapping the incoming energy from the sun And your point about it being possible to control pollution is absolutely correct We need to stop both plastic pollution and air pollution from fossil fuels That pollution is what is having such a severe impact on the climate Also side note How were medieval times prosperous,269,hurricane greenhouses correct need regarding fluctuations severe prosperous share equivalent side day natural better existed climate handy hard statistics dont greenhouse trapping result effect temperatures cold also heading long hence control deep humans range mass die question parts ones events space one world suns ocean inside extinction however warmer rise kelp points work go medieval temperature couple meaning heat places times energy incoming impact video within sunny notice working recent helping happening weather sun colder far hotter possible showing pollution fuels bringing stop fossil water global average literal sources across large years coral restore actually guess outside wildfires cool organization uniformly factor since polar believe previous whats true exactly vortex extreme get surrounding huge air note respond plastic occurred point zero absolutely please

,"One of the problems with your reimagining of my example is the the environmental movement has been making similar claims of imminent catastrophe for decades. None of them have come true. So they keep moving the goal posts and redefining what catastrophe would look like.

Another even bigger problem is that dissenting opinion is censored. You’re labeled a heretic in academia if you express skepticism (Judith Curry is a case in point) and you can’t publish papers or get any funding.

Additionally, there are many respected scientists who see problems with the science. Judith Curry is one such scientist, but there are many others. And typically their work is dismissed with ad hominem attacks, not scientific rebuttals.

The environmental movement’s religious fervor and repeated false doomsday predictions have done a lot of damage to its credibility.

,"OK, let's tease this apart: ""imminent catastrophe for decades"". First, if I say, ""You're going to crash into that wall in 50 yards?"" You're going to say, ""Ah, I've gone 49 yards without hitting a wall. I'm doing fine and your theory of an imminent crash is bunk!"" Second, the super big catastrophe is not imminent: It's many decades out. But: We have to start working on it now because it's a cumulative problem. If your car has shit for brakes, you better tell me ""the wall is coming and you better start pumping those brakes now!"" Deceleration takes time. Third, catastrophe of some sort is NOW. Ask the people who are losing their houses in California wild fires. Or the damage from any of the recent super storms. Or the people of Florida whose streets are flooding. Or the people of Kiribati whose islands are literally disappearing. It may not be a catastrophe for you because you might live above sea level away from the coasts... but it's a catastrophe for many and it will only get worse. Even if you climate change doesn't directly effect you, what will you say when millions of people want to immigrate to your country, because their homes are unlivable?

Dissenting opinions do have a hard time being heard: but that's because the massive consensus of science has already proven Climate Change to be real. You won't find much scientific funding for mercury as medicine anymore because mercury has been proven poisonous. You won't find much anti-vax research because vaccines have been proven safe.

OK, you can name 1 scientist who feels like they can't speak out. Almost every other scientist believes climate change exists. So, just because one scientist feels silenced, you don't believe the rest?

The funny thing about ""false doomsday predictions"" is if you do something to STOP DOOMSDAY, then the doomsday prediction will be wrong. But that doesn't mean the prediction was useless. Scientist and politicians worked hard to prevent Y2K doomsday. We didn't have doomsday. They worked hard to stop acid rain. We don't have an acid rain problem. They worked hard to stop the hole in the ozone layer (the ozone is pretty safe now... except China is breaking the rules and making the ozone hole bigger.) They worked hard to stop nuclear war and we haven't had a nuke used in anger since WWII.

If someone predicts doomsday and you take actions to stop it, that doesn't mean the doomsday prediction was bad: It meant you took an action to fix it and the prediction served its purpose.

,"I have logic. ~80% of our energy comes from fossil fuels. Less than 3% comes from wind and solar. The only possible way you could get rid of fossil fuels in 12 years is if we massively decreased our energy consumption.

Every bit as important is the reliability of the energy source. Try running a hospital or government on intermittent energy sources like wind or solar.

How is agriculture going to be done? The entire industry is heavily dependent on diesel. How is it going to be transported and refrigerated?

How are people going to heat their houses in the winter and cool them in the summer?

And that’s to say nothing of the impact to the economy. Data centers and the internet backbone use huge amounts of energy. Bye bye internet. Tech companies, the oil industry, transportation industry, the travel industry, the construction industry, etc. are all heavily dependent on huge amounts of energy and employ huge numbers of people.

Here’s another fundamental problem. Energy from wind and solar are very expensive. Wind energy, for example, is five times as expensive as coal energy.

The Green New Deal is ambitious, I’ll give it that. But it would entail catastrophic economic disruption.",I have logic of our energy comes from fossil fuels Less than comes from wind and solar The only possible way you could get rid of fossil fuels in years is if we massively decreased our energy consumption Every bit as important is the reliability of the energy source Try running a hospital or government on intermittent energy sources like wind or solar How is agriculture going to be done The entire industry is heavily dependent on diesel How is it going to be transported and refrigerated How are people going to heat their houses in the winter and cool them in the summer And thats to say nothing of the impact to the economy Data centers and the internet backbone use huge amounts of energy Bye bye internet Tech companies the oil industry transportation industry the travel industry the construction industry etc are all heavily dependent on huge amounts of energy and employ huge numbers of people Heres another fundamental problem Energy from wind and solar are very expensive Wind energy for example is five times as expensive as coal energy The Green New Deal is ambitious Ill give it that But it would entail catastrophic economic disruption,199,economic decreased like ambitious done important bit thats five source give running entire amounts try diesel wind bye entail people numbers economy another rid say solar comes industry use less ill way centers tech expensive could disruption fundamental reliability catastrophic employ transported would going green new every heat travel agriculture times consumption energy impact companies dependent coal massively possible data example intermittent winter heavily fuels fossil deal houses government sources backbone years internet etc cool nothing refrigerated construction get summer heres transportation oil huge hospital logic problem

Heres’s a small sampling of doomsday predictions that didn’t come true because they were flat wrong, not because drastic action was taken to avert them:

 1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”

2. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.

3. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”

4. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”

5. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”

6. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”

7. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.

8. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”

9. In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”

10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”

11. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.

12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.

13. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).

14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.'”

15. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.

16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”

17. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”

18. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”",I could name nonalarmists off the top of my head Check out the Oregon petition for a list of more Heress a small sampling of

Equip me in the debate on global warming,"Hey Reddit,

Since the start of my awareness of global warming I've been in support of the wealth of science supporting the theories about human activity affecting our climate. Recently I've been in discussions with seemingly learned people who questioned these beliefs and as a person who likes to get my data the right way I went about researching the topic when I came upon a very interesting article review about the subject in support of skepticism.

The article, ""The Global Warming Debate: A Review of the State of Science"" by Khandekar et. al. is from 2005, which is a noteworthy amount of time in such a well researched field. It's an interesting read though. (Not sure if I can link, Google scholar provides the pdf)

I then went about trying to find follow-up on the points made and if they have been clarified in recent studies but I've kind of hit a dead end.

Basically what I'm asking is: if and how the criticisms laid out by the authors have been dispelled. If you can offer some answers or at least point me in the right direction I'd be much obliged. 

The criticisms in question are mainly about:
The effect of urbanisation and land-use change
Solar variability
Extreme weather events and whether it's more a perceptional change rather than an actual change

If you haven't read the article please do. I'm not interested in general responses about what the science today is in agreement of (I am aware and not disputing it), but rather looking for answers on the specifics brought up in the article.",Hey Reddit Since the start of my awareness of global warming Ive been in support of the wealth of science supporting the theories about human activity affecting our climate Recently Ive been in discussions with seemingly learned people who questioned these beliefs and as a person who likes to get my data the right way I went about researching the topic when I came upon a very interesting article review about the subject in support of skepticism The article The Global Warming Debate A Review of the State of Science by Khandekar et al is from which is a noteworthy amount of time in such a well researched field Its an interesting read though Not sure if I can link Google scholar provides the pdf I then went about trying to find followup on the points made and if they have been clarified in recent studies but Ive kind of hit a dead end Basically what Im asking is if and how the criticisms laid out by the authors have been dispelled If you can offer some answers or at least point me in the right direction Id be much obliged The criticisms in question are mainly about The effect of urbanisation and landuse change Solar variability Extreme weather events and whether its more a perceptional change rather than an actual change If you havent read the article please do Im not interested in general responses about what the science today is in agreement of I am aware and not disputing it but rather looking for answers on the specifics brought up in the article,265,went perceptional researching mainly well followup article theories criticisms noteworthy review skepticism much authors made climate end brought researched clarified offer effect trying field learned amount whether interested people wealth answers direction solar upon read question time basically khandekar events variability way laid aware id interesting specifics subject state least sure person hey human points et provides discussions havent seemingly science debate ive find urbanisation start studies link hit right recent dead weather likes looking recently agreement data questioned rather though google landuse global change pdf supporting scholar al affecting topic asking reddit actual came general since warming kind obliged support im today get extreme activity dispelled responses awareness beliefs disputing point please
,"The article presents three separate arguments as the ""case against global warming,"" so let's take a look at each in detail.

# Heat-island effect

>Among the important issues that we discuss here are:  
>  
>1: Mean temperature calculation and the impact of urbanization and land-use change; mean temperature changes on regional and hemispheric scale and their variation in the context of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and other mechanisms.

Khandekar et al. suggest that the urbanization induced heat island effect could account for some of the observed **global** warming. Remarkably, they actually offer nothing in the way of support for this suggestion in their own paper, instead relying on the citation of observed **local** effects. Notably. every paper that they cite for the **global** contribution of the heat-island effect suggests a small contribution, (Jones et al. 1990, Hansen et al. 1997).

Indeed, a landmark paper by [Wickham et al. (2013)](http://www.scitechnol.com/2327-4581/2327-4581-1-104.pdf), associated with the independent scientific organization [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/), essentially put to rest this supposition. Berkeley Earth, I will note, was set up with the [explicit intention](http://berkeleyearth.org/about/) to treat seriously the concerns of skeptics. Their analysis represented the largest ensemble of station data at the time, 39,300 temperature stations. In the paper they compared the global temperature trend from ""very-rural"" stations to all other stations. Their analysis contradicted the Urban-Heat Island hypothesis, and as summarized rather bluntly on their [FAQ](https://berkeleyearth.org/archive/faq/#question-15) page,

>Our UHI paper analyzing this indicates that the urban heat island effect on our global estimate of land temperatures is **indistinguishable from zero**.

From the paper,

>We observe the **opposite** of an urban heating effect over the period 1950 to 2010, with a slope of -0.10 ± 0.24°C/100yr (2σ error) in the Berkeley Earth global land temperature average. The confidence interval is **consistent with a zero urban heating effect**, and at most a small urban heating effect (less than 0.14°C/100yr, with 95% confidence) on the scale of the observed warming (1.9 ± 0.1°C/100 yr since 1950 in the land average from Figure 5A).

[Figure 5](https://skepticalscience.com/pics/BESTfig3.jpg) shows that the trend in global temperature rise of all sites and rural sites.

# Solar Variability

>2. The impact of solar variability on climate change (and global warming) in geological times as well as on shorter time scales of a few hundred to a few thousand years

In support of their conjecture that solar variability could explain some of the observed global warming they offer two lines of argumentation, which should be distinguished: firstly, that the sun has driven climate change over geological timescales; secondly, that the sun could be driving climate change over the observed record.

The first argument is an obvious non-sequitur, and irrelevant to the issue at hand. Changes in the sun's irradiance on timescales of hundreds of thousands, or millions of years says nothing of variability on decadal timescales. I will not engage further with this asinine argument, which is **willfully** in bad faith.

Now to the second argument. In support of their argument, they cite Lean et. al (1995), Lean and Rind (1998), and Rind and Overpeck (1993), among other sources.

>These studies now suggest that solar forcing can be significant and may have contributed significantly to the observed warming of the earth’s surface. According to LEAN et al. (1995) and LEAN and RIND (1998), solar forcing may have contributed to about half of the observed warming of 0.55 C since 1860 and about one third of the warming since 1970. Lean and Rind further state that since 1970, GHG forcing has been significantly larger than solar forcing and consequently the solar forcing signal in the global warming data cannot be easily isolated. Other studies, notably by RIND and OVERPECK (1993), SOON et al. (1996) and POSMENTIER et al. (1998) have suggested that up to 78% of earth’s warming between 1885 and 1987 can be accounted for by an increase in the sun’s irradiance

Let's see what Lean and Rind have said since 2005... [Lean and Rind (2008)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL034864) found that anthropogenic forcing is the only explanation for the trend in global average temperatures from 1905-2005. They found that natural forcings were at least an order of magnitude lesser than anthropogenic forcing, and that solar forcing ""contributed negligible long-term warming in the past 25 years, and 10% of the warming in the past 100 years.""

It is now virtually undisputed that direct solar forcing from variations in activity could not have contributed to the period of most rapid global warming since 1975, because we have by then direct measurements of total solar irradiance, [which has decreased over that period](https://www.carbonbrief.org/why-the-sun-is-not-responsible-for-recent-climate-change/).

# Sea-Level Rise

Quoting from Khandekar again,

>3. Consequences of global warming in terms of the ‘‘increase in mean sea-level and in extreme weather events world-wide.’’  
>  
>Sea level has been rising naturally since the end of the last ice age and this has not accelerated recently.

This is just brazenly false, and it was actually false when it was written. In sole support of this claim they cite... a now defunct climate denial blog... As a matter of fact, evidence was already mounting by 2005 of an acceleration in global sea level rise.

[Cazenave et al. (2003),](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026238318585)

>For the last four decades, thermal contribution is estimated to about 0.5 mm/yr, with a possible accelerated rate of thermosteric rise during the 1990s. Topex/Poseidon shows an increase in mean sea level of 2.5 mm/yr over the last decade, a value about two times larger than reported by historical tide gauges. This would suggest that there has been significant acceleration of sea level rise in the recent past, possibly related to ocean warming.

[Evidence for enhanced coastal sea level rise during the 1990s](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004GL019626)

>We present evidence from altimeter data that the rate of sea level rise around the global coastline was significantly in excess of the global average over the period 1993–2002. We also show that the globally-averaged rate of coastal sea level rise for the decade centered on 1955 was significantly larger than any other decade during the past 55 years. In some models of sea level rise, enhanced coastal rise is a pre-cursor of global average rise.

[Onset of recent rapid sea-level rise in the western Atlantic Ocean](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379105001344)

>The 19th century sea level rose at a mean rate of 1.6 mm/yr. Between AD 1900 and AD 1920, sea-level rise accelerated to the modern mean rate of 3.2 mm/yr. This acceleration corresponds in time with global temperature rise and may therefore be associated with recent global warming.

Strangely, Khandekar didn't see fit to cite any of this published research on the topic, or offer a correction to their submitted article, instead citing only a single blog... Fun fact, they cite this blog eight times in their paper, making it their singularly most relied upon source. What a joke.

The following year, [Church and White (2006)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL024826) would publish their seminal work confirming the predictions of the previous IPCC reports. A prediction, I will note, *by Khandekar's own reasoning* (since they claimed there was no evidence of an acceleration), must be completely inexplicable without the help of climate models.

>A reconstruction of global sea level using tide-gauge data from 1950 to 2000 indicates a larger rate of rise after 1993 and other periods of rapid sea-level rise but no significant acceleration over this period. Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 ± 0.006 mm yr−2. This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the IPCC TAR.

# More to come.... but need I continue?",The article presents three separate arguments as the case against global warming so lets take a look at each in detail Heatisland effect Among the important issues that we discuss here are Mean temperature calculation and the impact of urbanization and landuse change mean temperature changes on regional and hemispheric scale and their variation in the context of largescale atmospheric circulation patterns and other mechanisms Khandekar et al suggest that the urbanization induced heat island effect could account for some of the observed global

,"The paper is pretty much a faceplate for denial. They use the 1998 super El Nino, questionable past measurements, claimed urban heat island causation, and so on. There has been almost 20 years of scientific data since that. If they accept that scientific paper why not 20 years of subsequent scientific papers pointing to human causation? Why are they picking and choosing what to believe instead of reading the emerging science? The warming is due to increases in tropospheric radiation at the 15 micron band and water vapor continuum as shown by Harries, 2001, Griggs 2007 and up to the most recent paper by brindley

,"Keep in mind that 99% of the population that searches the web for climate change science ONLY gets Pro-Climate Alarmism websites and are NOT given access to all of the data. 

Simply go back and watch Al Gore’s movie “An Inconvenient Truth” with a pen and a notepad. Write down all his predictions in that movie and te dates they were supposed to happen. 

Al Gore clearly had the latest data and the best scientists hires to compile all the climate data we had at that time and as you heard there first,”The Science is Settled…”. Any human being on any side of this debate can see that Al Gore and his team scored a 0.00% from that movie. 

The Earth was threatened of an ice age in the early 1970s & in fact, the earth has cooled from 2017-2020 yet almost ZERO media outlets would publish or air these findings. 

This is all theory. Yes we are warming, and cooling, and changing. 

Water vapor in our atmosphere affects temperature significantly more than the 0.04% (parts per million) of CO2 that everyone is freaking out about. 

Google the relationship between CO2 & Temps in the Eocene & Pleistocene eras. The data suggests almost no real relation between CO2 and temperature. 

Also notice that the temperature changes on Mars has almost mirrored the earth (different temps but the lines are almost exactly parallel), so the temperature raises and cools on Mara at the same rate as Earth yet there are no humans, no Diesel engines, no fracking, no volcanoes (that we know of yet), and no green plants. 

I am not making any kind of conclusion here, just pointing out factors that you will never, ever,ever,ever,ever,ever,ever hear from NASA or 98+% of Scientists.

,"I think one of the most important skills to learn is to choose steel manning opposing arguments instead of straw manning and learning how to counter those arguments.  Those who quote old papers with low quality of evidence likely won't have their opinion changed anyway if it's like a religion to them.  But steel manning someone else's arguments at least shows that you are listening to them, so they might listen to you more.

That's what their idea of a skeptic is, and there is a place for that.  I know the standard response to a site like that is to completely dismiss it or attack the writers/editors, but it's still good practice to identify if there's any valid criticism they have and general quality of evidence.  While there are articles on there that are completely bonkers, there also exist good faith articles too with valid points.

,"I have a completely non-scientific observation to explain the validity and danger of man-made climate change.

For almost decades, roughly 2000-2015, we heard the deniers, some willfully ignorant and some deliberately obfuscating, use the words ""climate alarmist"" or ""global warming alarmist.""

You rarely hear that accusation any more.  Maybe from a neighbor or family friend who is probably also anti-vaxxer, but the cacophony of cries from the right using the word ""alarmist"" have almost disappeared.  Why?  Because the accumulation of catastrophic events of the last decade, and the constant, global warming trend have rendered those pitiful protestations mute.

For example, in a 2006 interview renowned hurricane expert Dr. William Gray claimed there would be a global cooldown within 3 to 4 years.

[https://www.denverpost.com/2006/06/04/chill-out-over-global-warming/](https://www.denverpost.com/2006/06/04/chill-out-over-global-warming/)*""Gray acknowledges that we’ve had some warming the past 30 years. “I don’t question that,” he explains. “And humans might have caused a very slight amount of this warming. Very slight. But this warming trend is not going to keep on going. My belief is that three, four years from now, the globe will start to cool again, as it did from the middle ’40s to the middle ’70s.”*

Others also kept claiming that a cool down was going to happen.

,"Yeah, that's a fair point. My argument is more along the lines of ""if the majority of Christians, especially the most ardent of them, claim that their religion says X, that's pretty good evidence that they're correct."" So I've grown more skeptical of attempts to ""reclaim"" or ""reform"" Christianity to be in line with modern values.

As I think about this more, the real problem with trying to reclaim Christianity is that even if you're successful, people are still using the Bible as their source of authority, not their reason. That's the same with a liberal or a fundamentalist Christian. And these reforms tend to lag social change, not lead it. See liberal churches and gay marriage, for example.

,">My argument is more along the lines of ""if the majority of Christians, especially the most ardent of them, claim that their religion says X, that's pretty good evidence that they're correct.

The fun thing about studying history is watching groups of Christians split off from other groups and re-interperet the text to be more aligned with their own values. Who the 'majority' is really depends on what time period & location you're looking at.

Church philosopher Augustine in 340-430 emphasized a focus on the Bible, rather than church officials as the ultimate religious authority. He preached that 'only god can bestow salvation by his divine grace', and grace could not be earned - but the Catholic church in the middle ages taught that salvation was possible through righteous 'good works' that pleased god. They said **you had to** ***do good*** **in order to get to heaven. Thinking good thoughts wasn't enough.** They taught that for centuries.

In 1517, scholar-monk Martin Luther penned a document. (He had a doctorate after studying at the University of Erfurt and another university in Wittenberg, and was a professor of biblical studies, and studied Augustine's work in depth.) In his document, he attacked the Catholic church's increasingly corrupt practice of selling ""Indulgences"" to absolve sin. In exchange for certain prayers, ***donations***, or pilgrimages in special years, a Catholic could receive an *indulgence*, which reduced or erased the punishment of sinning instantly, with no formal ceremony or sacrament. This quickly became: 'rich people can pay off the church and sin as much as they want with no spiritual consequence, because the church can use money to help people....or just make their stuff nicer.'

Martin Luther is famously painted nailing his dissertation: ""Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences"" also called ""95 Theses"" to the doors of the Wittenberg Castle church.

The document basically said that god intended believers to seek repentance. That their *faith*, not their deeds, would lead to salvation.  In addition, he criticized the church directly: ""*Why does not* ***the pope,*** *whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with* ***his own money*** *rather than with the money of poor believers?*""

Pope Leo X concluded Luther's writings were heretical, and that he should publicly recant. King Henry VIII in England agreed & the pope gave him a nice title. Luther refused. He was excommunicated from the church in 1521. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V ordered his writings to be burned, but they'd already been spread across Germany.

Before all this began, Luther was mostly known for his writings about how clerics of the church (priests, friars, monks, etc.) should be allowed to fuck. As the Protestant Reformation sparked and spread across Europe, Luther wasn't really involved - he had married an ex-nun and had 5 children with her. In a time where chamber-pots were still common, he had a toilet with a seat & dedicated cesspit under it, in a bathroom with a heated floor. The man fucked.

About a decade later, King Henry VII decided his wife wasn't getting pregnant fast enough so he wanted to divorce Catherine & hook up with one of her ladies in waiting (Anne). Unlucky for him the holy roman empire had just destroyed Rome, forcing the pope to flee. Papacy now almost entirely under HRE control, Henry needed imperial permission as well as pope permission to divorce Catherine.Coincidentally, the *Emperor* of the holy roman empire already Catherine's favorite nephew, King-of-Spain Clement VII. As you can imagine, favorite-nephew-emperor-king Clement VII was not inclined to grant the divorce.

They waffled for a bit, Henry got impatient, and Protestants Cranmer and Cromwell, advisors to Henry, built a case that England's king shouldn't be subject to the pope's jurisdiction. 'Great idea!' said Henry as he appointed Cranmer as the archbishop of Canterbury, so Cranmer could grant Henry's divorce from Catherine. In 1533, Anne was already very obviously already pregnant when she was crowned queen of England. England's Protestant reformation began.

""*Belief* is more important than *deeds*"" said the protestants. ""You can't *pay* to have sin absolved, god is above money!""Disgraceful Heretics,"" said the Eastern Orthodox Catholics ""Thinking happy thoughts doesn't actually improve the world god gave us, and respecting/glorifying His temple is in scripture!""

Funny enough, Henry VIII apparently remained a conservative catholic who hated Martin Luthor until his death. Despite the reformation of his whole-ass country, he wasn't a protestant 🤷",My argument is more along the lines of if the majority of Christians especially the most ardent of them claim that their

It seems like catholics basically track exactly with the US average on various climate change questions: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/06/16/catholics-divided-over-global-warming/

To your point that american catholics are more liberal than protestants: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/political-ideology/
We see pretty much the exact same results. Catholics are more liberal than mormons and evangelicals, neck and neck with mainline protestants, and more conservative than any other religion group.

It's possible these numbers have changed, but that sort of proves my point: religious reform tends to lag behind social changes, not lead them.

,"Will the correlation between the atmospheric CO2 level and the average global temperature soon start to fall apart?

When I look at graphs comparing atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average temperature, such as this one: [https://johnenglander.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CO2-Temperature%20420%20kyr.gif](https://johnenglander.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CO2-Temperature%20420%20kyr.gif) , I see a very obvious relationship that spans across past millennia. However, I also see that the trends in CO2 concentration tend to follow that of the temperature. In other words, higher or lower temperatures seem to cause higher or lower amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere, and not the other way around. This is contrary to the mainstream narrative of anthropogenic global warming. This is especially apparent in how drops in the CO2 level tend to lag drops in temperature, often by many centuries.

One explanation given is that the oceans have historically been the greatest contributor to atmospheric CO2. Higher ocean temperatures mean they release more CO2 into the atmosphere, and lower ocean temperatures mean that they are better at absorbing it. Since the oceans are so big and it can take a very long time to either heat or cool them compared to the air and the land, this could explain the lag in the relationship.

The atmospheric CO2 level has shot up since the start of the Industrial Revolution. This unnatural increase is apparent at the far right end of the graph I linked to above. Supposedly, the atmospheric CO2 concentration today is the highest it's been in almost a million years. That may well be true, and it seems obvious to me that a lot of the recent increase has been due to human activity. But if CO2 emissions (whether natural or man-made) don't actually contribute to higher temperatures, but are merely a symptom of it, then we shouldn't expect the global average temperature to follow the same curve. The world may suddenly start to cool from other causes (such as quieting solar activity, changes in Earth's orbit, less heat being transferred from the Earth's core, or some other forces that are still poorly understood) and yet the atmospheric CO2 level may keep rising from fossil fuel emissions regardless. Alternatively, these or other natural forces could keep global temperatures rising even as human civilization abandons fossil fuels and uses cleaner sources of energy (such as space-based solar power, which I see as being in our future).

Even within the short time span that human industrial activity has massively contributed to CO2 emissions, I see important clues that it's not the cause for the recent global warming. Here's a graph showing the average global temperature and the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past 150 years: [https://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource\_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/22/05/f91f3e0f9de762a469592dc44804/CS\_global\_temp\_and\_co2\_1880-2012\_V3.png?itok=\_eLJDZSz](https://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/22/05/f91f3e0f9de762a469592dc44804/CS_global_temp_and_co2_1880-2012_V3.png?itok=_eLJDZSz) Notice that between roughly 1940 and 1975, the global average temperature wasn't rising, and even dipped slightly. In the 1970's, many scientists and the mainstream media were warning of an impending ice age based on the previous few decades of data. Yet during this period, the atmospheric CO2 level began to rise precipitously, likely due to the post-war industrial boom. Also notice that, between roughly 1910 and 1940, the rate of the global average temperature increase was about the same (if not more) than the rate of increase between 1975 and the present. But the atmospheric CO2 level was only gradually increasing during the former period, as human industrial activity was not yet widespread.

So in conclusion, I think that there historically really was a relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentration and the average global temperature, but the relationship was the inverse of what the mainstream narrative has led most to believe. Do you think, now that human activity contributes a significant chunk to CO2 emissions, and that temperature changes are likely due to unrelated causes, that the relationship between the two could soon fall apart?",Will the correlation between the atmospheric CO level and the average global temperature soon start to fall apart When I look at graphs comparing atmospheric CO concentration and

historically been the greatest contributor to atmospheric CO Higher ocean temperatures mean they release more CO into the atmosphere and lower ocean temperatures mean that they are better at absorbing it Since the oceans are so big and it can take a very long time to either heat or cool them compared to the air and the land this could explain the lag in the relationship The atmospheric CO level has shot up since the start of the Industrial Revolution This unnatural increase is apparent at the far right end of the graph I linked to above Supposedly the atmospheric CO concentration today is the highest its been in almost a million years That may well be true and it seems obvious to me that a lot of the recent increase has been due to human activity But if CO emissions whether natural or manmade dont actually contribute to higher temperatures but are merely a symptom of it then we shouldnt expect the global average temperature to follow the same curve The world may suddenly start to cool from other causes such as quieting solar activity changes in Earths orbit less heat being transferred from the Earths core or some other forces that are still poorly understood and yet the atmospheric CO level may keep rising from fossil fuel emissions regardless Alternatively these or other natural forces could keep global temperatures rising even as human civilization abandons fossil fuels and uses cleaner sources of energy such as spacebased solar power which I see as being in our future Even within the short time span that human industrial activity has massively contributed to CO emissions I see important clues that its not the cause for the recent global warming Heres a graph showing the average global temperature and the atmospheric CO concentration over the past years Notice that between roughly and the global average temperature wasnt rising and even dipped slightly In the s many scientists and the mainstream media were warning of an impending ice age based on the previous few decades of data Yet during this period the atmospheric CO level began to rise precipitously likely due to the postwar industrial boom Also notice that between roughly and the rate of the global average temperature increase was about the same if not more than the rate of increase between and the present But the atmospheric CO level was only gradually increasing during the former period as human industrial activity was not yet widespread So in conclusion I think that there historically really was a relationship between atmospheric CO concentration and the average global temperature but the relationship was the inverse of what the mainstream narrative has led most to believe Do you think now that human activity contributes a significant chunk to CO emissions and that temperature changes are likely due to unrelated causes that the relationship between the two could soon fall apart,613,lot apparent alternatively led well scientists ice media atmosphere see still million co

You don't understand much apparently.  The cause of temperature increases and decreases, with the corresponding increases and decreases in CO2 over the last million years is due to Milankovitch Cycles.  This is very very well understood https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles

----

We know that we have increased CO2 levels by burning ancient carbon (oil, coal, natural gas) by looking at the relative isotopes of C12, C13, and C14.

>During all of the cycles between ice ages and warm periods over the past million years, atmospheric carbon dioxide never climbed higher than 300 parts per million. At the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago, it was 280 ppm. Today it is close to 410. The increase between the year 1800 and today is 70% larger than the increase that occurred when Earth climbed out of the last ice age between 17,500 and 11,500 years ago, and it occurred 100-200 times faster. Only fossil fuels—which are the remains of millions of years of carbon uptake by plants—contain enough carbon to produce such a massive change in such a short time.

>In addition, only fossil fuels are consistent with the isotopic fingerprint of the carbon in today’s atmosphere. Different kinds of carbon-containing material have different relative amounts of “light” carbon-12, “heavy” carbon-13, and radioactive carbon-14. Plant matter is enriched in carbon-12, because its lighter weight is more readily used by plants during photosynthesis. Volcanic emissions are enriched in carbon-13. The ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere and the ocean are roughly the same. Since carbon-14 is radioactive, it decays predictably over time. Young organic matter has more carbon-14 than older organic matter, and fossil fuels have no measurable carbon-14 at all.

>As carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen over the past century or more, the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 has fallen, which means that the source of the extra carbon dioxide must be enriched in ""light"" carbon-12. Meanwhile, the relative amount of carbon-14—radioactive carbon—has declined. The record of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is complicated by nuclear bomb testing after 1950, which doubled the amount of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere. After the nuclear test ban treaty in 1963, the excess atmospheric carbon-14 began to decline as it dispersed into the oceans and the land biosphere.

>In the last four decades, however, the decline of carbon-14 has been noticeably faster than can be explained by continuing dispersal of the bomb-related carbon-14. This faster decline is driven by the addition to the atmosphere of huge amounts of carbon dioxide from a source with no carbon-14. As this carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it dilutes the ratio of 14-carbon dioxide (i.e., carbon dioxide containing a carbon-14 atom) to total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

>Taken together, then, we are looking for a source of carbon dioxide that comes from terrestrial plants (because they are depleted in ""heavy"" carbon-13), is so old that any carbon-14 it once contained has decayed to non-detectable levels, and is capable of creating a pulse of carbon dioxide that is larger and faster than anything that’s occurred in at least the past million years. Only fossil fuels meet all those criteria.

,"Really? Sounds like he had a good grasp of it, regardless of his confusion over chemistry.

Contrary to what you're implying, this isn't rocket science. It doesn't take a huge leap of intuition to understand that if you add more of a gas to the atmosphere that traps heat, the Earth might in fact get hotter over time. Of course, global warming is more complex than that, because the Earth is a complex system. Most people think that a 2 or 3 or 5 degree shift in temperature isn't a big deal, because if the temperature is 75 one day and 80 the next, nobody dies from that. What they fail to consider is how much energy that represents when applied to the entire planet, especially the oceans, which trap vast amounts of energy and drive global weather patterns. 5 degrees won't kill humans, but it might well kill plankton or other tiny creatures that are a critical part of the food chain, that could well trigger at least a partial collapse of an ecosystem that feeds a billion people. 5 degrees won't kill humans but it might kill insects or disrupt their breeding patterns enough to cause a population collapse and interfere with pollination or other food chains. 5 degrees might not kill humans but it might melt enough ice to flood cities and land where hundreds of millions of people live.

* Sagan also spoke of the dangers of nuclear winter  [article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-carl-sagan-warned-world-about-nuclear-winter-180967198/)

[here is Carl Sagan testifying in congress in 1985 on the green house effect and global warming](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp-WiNXH6hI)

And here is a quote from cosmos 

“There is an additional factor that can alter the landscape and the climate of Earth: intelligent life, able to make major environmental changes. Like Venus, the Earth also has a greenhouse effect due to its carbon dioxide and water vapor. The global temperature of the Earth would be below the freezing point of water if not for the greenhouse effect. It keeps the oceans liquid and life possible. A little greenhouse is a good thing. Like Venus, the Earth also has about 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide; but it resides in the crust as limestone and other carbonates, not in the atmosphere. If the Earth were moved only a little closer to the Sun, the temperature would increase slightly. This would drive some of the CO2 out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, which would in turn incrementally heat the surface further. A hotter surface would vaporize still more carbonates into CO2, and there would be the possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect to very high temperatures. This is just what we think happened in the early history of Venus, because of Venus' proximity to the Sun. The surface environment of Venus is a warning: something disastrous can happen to a planet rather like our own.  

The principal energy sources of our present industrial civilization are the so-called fossil fuels. We burn wood and oil, coal and natural gas, and, in the process, release waste gases, principally CO2, into the air. Consequently, the carbon dioxide content of the Earth's atmosphere is increasing dramatically. The possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect suggests that we have to be careful: Even a one- or two- degree rise in the global temperature can have catastrophic consequences. In the burning of coal and oil and gasoline, we are also putting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Like Venus, our stratosphere even now has a substantial mist of tiny sulfuric acid droplets. Our major cities are polluted with noxious molecules. We do not understand the long- term effects of our course of action….”

,"It literally is discussed and involved in every branch if science. When I got my biotech diploma it was brought up in chemistry class when discussing chemical equilibrium between CO2 in the air and carbonic acid in the ocean. Add more CO2 to the air, morsle dissolves into the water and reacts to create carbonic acid, pH goes down. Remove some from the air and the ocean would release some. It was also discussed when it came to various applications of biotech like biofuel and more efficient farming prqctices. Then when I did my BA in life science it was brought uo again in ecology classes, again in plant biology classes as invasive plants from warmer regions can settle in newer places. Brought up in anthro classes when discussing the various climate change events and causes of the past as well as applications of carbon dating (due to fossil fuels being burried in the ground away from the suns cosmic rays, but carbon based life like trees on the surface aren't, you can use carbon dating to tell how much carbon came from cellular respiration and forest fires, and how much came from ground sources like volcanoes and fossil fuels. It was brought up in physics classes when it came to learning about heat radiating and going from hot to cold, and how greenhouse gasses serve as an insukatir between the surface and space. Like it has literally came up in almost every science course just as a passive and well understood example on applications of said fields as well as how laws of nature work. You could remain completely apolotical, but if you study science you should not just know it is real, but how it is known to some degrees and how some aspects work.

I would recommend reading reputable scientific journals like Nature, PlosOne, Wiley, Science, many more. If the article is behind a paywall you can use Scihub and the DOI to get past it. All peer reviewed. All reputable as that is how they make their money (redacting anything shown to be wrong), and the beautiful thing about journal articles is you get to see their methods and not just take their word on it. If you doubt it, repeat it and try to prove them wrong. They provided the positive proof so the burden of proof is now to prove otherwise. Better than fringe people who take outliers in data and blow it up to sell a book, or politicians who open their mouth on things they often don't understand.",It literally is discussed and involved in every branch if science When I got my biotech diploma it was brought up in chemistry class when discussing chemical equilibrium between CO in the air and carbonic acid in the ocean Add more CO to the air morsle dissolves into the water and reacts to create carbonic acid pH goes down Remove some from the air and the ocean would release some It was also discussed when it came to various applications of biotech like biofuel and more efficient farming prqctices Then when I did my BA in life science it was brought uo again in ecology classes again in plant biology classes as invasive plants from warmer regions can settle in newer places Brought up in anthro classes when discussing the various climate change events and causes of the past as well as applications of carbon dating due to fossil fuels being burried in the ground away from the suns cosmic rays but carbon based life like trees on the surface arent you can use carbon dating to tell how much carbon came from cellular respiration and forest fires and how much came from ground sources like volcanoes and fossil fuels It was brought up in physics classes when it came to learning about heat radiating and going from hot to cold and how greenhouse gasses serve as an insukatir between the surface and space Like it has literally came up in almost every science course just as a passive and well understood example on applications of said fields as well as how laws of nature work You could remain completely apolotical but if you study science you should not just know it is real but how it is known to some degrees and how some aspects work I would recommend reading reputable scientific journals like Nature PlosOne Wiley Science many more If the article is behind a paywall you can use Scihub and the DOI to get past it All peer reviewed All reputable as that is how they make their money redacting anything shown to be wrong and the beautiful thing about journal articles is you get to see their methods and not just take their word on it If you doubt it repeat it and try to prove them wrong They provided the positive proof so the burden of proof is now to prove otherwise Better than fringe people who take outliers in data and blow it up to sell a book or politicians who open their mouth on things they often dont understand,426,regions scientific politicians efficient plants wrong like biofuel book forest invasive well trees nature plosone article cosmic ground otherwise money see chemistry co make wiley fires open much farming apolotical better discussing methods branch brought climate try dont journals greenhouse literally cold also laws take people insukatir mouth add ph thing know redacting anthro dissolves volcanoes shown events equilibrium positive understood space use ba suns based applications ocean various due could peer radiating diploma warmer things known repeat biology beautiful provided away respiration would going almost dating work behind often newer morsle recommend uo every heat places gasses science chemical anything ecology past word reacts classes create reading discussed many doi burden example data hot prove fuels fossil water release change class sources completely reviewed sell remove aspects proof physics real said fringe blow came learning settle got plant doubt course involved understand burried cellular arent prqctices rays fields get remain journal goes surface serve tell air causes life reputable carbonic articles acid passive paywall outliers biotech scihub study carbon degrees

> If we can hold temperatures to 1.5°C, cumulative permafrost emissions by 2100 will be about equivalent to those currently from Canada (150–200 Gt CO2-eq).
>
>  In contrast, by 2°C scientists expect cumulative permafrost emissions as large as those of the EU (220–300 Gt CO2-eq) .
>
>  If temperature exceeds 4°C by the end of the century however, permafrost emissions by 2100 will be as large as those today from major emitters like the United States or China (400–500 Gt CO2-eq), the same scale as the remaining 1.5° carbon budget.

For reference, the anthropogenic emissions in 2019 were were [over 50 Gt CO2 equivalent](https://www.pbl.nl/en/news/2020/growth-of-11-in-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-2019), so whatever permafrost emits by the end of the century, we'll emit in a few years.

To understand what this means in terms of warming: 1000 Gt CO2 leads to between 0.27 and 0.63 degrees of warming (most likely 0.45 degrees; see page 27 [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf)). This means that permafrost emissions would add roughly a quarter of whichever value you go with if the world stays at 2 C this century and half (i.e. 0.2 - 0.3 C) if the world emits up enough to reach 4 C by 2100.

Lastly, permafrost only really emits a lot of methane when it's waterlogged - otherwise, it's plain CO2, though since methane causes much more warming, a small fraction of methane has about the same effect as the remainder being CO2. A [recent study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JG006543) also suggests that unless (or until) the required microorganisms are present in the area, the emissions would be almost entirely CO2 even from waterlogged soils.",If we can hold temperatures to C cumulative permafrost emissions by will be about equivalent to those currently from Canada Gt COeq In contrast by C scientists expect cumulative permafrost emissions as large as those of the EU Gt COeq If temperature exceeds C by the end of the century however permafrost emissions by will be as large as those today from major emitters like the United States or China Gt COeq the same scale as the remaining carbon budget For reference the anthropogenic emissions in were were over Gt CO equivalent so whatever permafrost emits by the end of the century well emit in a few years To understand what this means in terms of warming Gt CO leads to between and degrees of warming most likely degrees see page here This means that permafrost emissions would add roughly a quarter of whichever value you go with if the world stays at C this century and half ie C if the world emits up enough to reach C by Lastly permafrost only really emits a lot of methane when its waterlogged otherwise its plain CO though since methane causes much more warming a small fraction of methane has about the same effect as the remainder being CO A recent study also suggests that unless or until the required microorganisms are present in the area the emissions would be almost entirely CO even from waterlogged soils,236,lot like whichever lastly terms well scientists otherwise fraction stays see equivalent co eu much unless end currently states waterlogged anthropogenic effect emit remaining temperatures also hold even add half roughly present plain united world soils scale however reference study area almost would contrast go budget temperature canada coeq emitters recent page quarter emissions likely required reach c china exceeds whatever ie really though means microorganisms large years suggests expect gt value since warming enough understand leads cumulative today methane small causes remainder entirely emits major century permafrost carbon degrees
,"> methane bubbling up.. it might not even matter

I thought climate scientists had prettty firmly ruled out the clathrate gun hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that warming will release a bunch of methane, which will then lead to large and rapid extra warming). 

I thought scientists ruled this out by looking at the methane released during previous warming periods, and showing that there’s nowhere near enough released to trigger the Clathrate Gun.

So, climate change will be bad, yes, and yes we need to address it. But no, there’s no evidence to suggest such a bad scenario that our actions limiting emissions might not matter.",methane bubbling up it might not even matter I thought climate scientists had prettty firmly ruled out the clathrate gun hypothesis ie the hypothesis that warming will release a bunch of methane which will then lead to large and rapid extra warming I thought scientists ruled this out by looking at the methane released during previous warming periods and showing that theres nowhere near enough released to trigger the Clathrate Gun So climate change will be bad yes and yes we need to address it But no theres no evidence to suggest such a bad scenario that our actions limiting emissions might not matter,104,gun bunch scenario released periods bubbling even hypothesis need thought scientists extra yes actions warming enough previous bad near clathrate methane address emissions ruled looking might nowhere ie lead matter showing climate trigger prettty release change firmly theres evidence rapid suggest large limiting

,"It s not so much that we passed a ""tipping point of no return""(we may have in some ways) but the simple fact that co2 in the atmosphere will take a very long time to naturally dissipate makes it so that we won't see  us going back to pre 2000 level in our lifetimes. Once we reach any level of co2 we are committed to see the consequences. We can't get to 2 degrees and expect to go back to current temperatures even a few decades later, unless we can efficiently get rid of co2 in the atmosphere in some artificial way.

>The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop.

> **Over millennia under any warmer climate, the ice sheet reaches a new steady state**, whose mass is correlated with the magnitude of global climate change imposed. If a climate that gives the recently observed SMB were maintained, global-mean sea level rise (GMSLR) would reach 0.5–2.5 m. For any global warming exceeding 3 K, the contribution to GMSLR exceeds 5 m. For the largest global warming considered (about +5 K), the rate of GMSLR is initially 2.7 mm yr^−1, and eventually only a small ice cap endures, resulting in over 7 m of GMSLR. Our analysis gives a qualitatively different impression from previous work in that we do not find a sharp threshold warming that divides scenarios in which the ice sheet suffers little reduction from those in which it is mostly lost.
>
> The final steady state is achieved by withdrawal from the coast in some places and a tendency for increasing SMB due to enhancement of cloudiness and snowfall over the remaining ice sheet by the effects of topographic change on atmospheric circulation, outweighing the tendency for decreasing SMB from the reduction in surface altitude. If late 20th-century climate is restored after the ice sheet mass has fallen below a threshold of about 4 m of sea level equivalent, it will not regrow to its present extent because the snowfall in the northern part of the island is reduced once the ice sheet retreats from there. **In that case, about 2 m of GMSLR would become irreversible. In order to avoid this outcome, anthropogenic climate change must be reversed before the ice sheet has declined to the threshold mass, which would be reached in about 600 years at the highest rate of mass loss** within the likely range of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

We *are* set to lose enough Antarctic ice to result in several metres of sea level rise from that alone, though.

> Here we show that the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits a multitude of temperature thresholds beyond which ice loss is irreversible. Consistent with palaeodata we find, using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, that at global warming levels around 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, West Antarctica is committed to long-term partial collapse owing to the marine ice-sheet instability. Between 6 and 9 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the loss of more than 70 per cent of the present-day ice volume is triggered, mainly caused by the surface elevation feedback. **At more than 10 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, Antarctica is committed to become virtually ice-free**. The ice sheet’s temperature sensitivity is 1.3 metres of sea-level equivalent per degree of warming up to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, almost doubling to 2.4 metres per degree of warming between 2 and 6 degrees and increasing to about 10 metres per degree of warming between 6 and 9 degrees. 

However, that will be just as spread out over many centuries as any Greenland melt.

> Sea-level rise projections and knowledge of their uncertainties are vital to make informed mitigation and adaptation decisions. To elicit projections from members of the scientific community regarding future global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise, we repeated a survey originally conducted five years ago. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, 106 experts projected a likely (central 66% probability) GMSL rise of 0.30–0.65 m by 2100, and 0.54–2.15 m by 2300, relative to 1986–2005. Under RCP 8.5, the same experts projected a likely GMSL rise of 0.63–1.32 m by 2100, and 1.67–5.61 m by 2300. Expert projections for 2100 are similar to those from the original survey, although the projection for 2300 has extended tails and is higher than the original survey.

By 2300, the likely range is 1.67–5.61 m, the very likely range is 0.88–7.83 m, and the median is 3.29 m",full melting of Greenland takes much much more effort than what has occurred so far Over millennia under any warmer climate the ice sheet reaches a new steady state whose mass is correlated with the magnitude of global climate change imposed If a climate that gives the recently observed SMB were maintained globalmean sea level rise GMSLR would reach m For any global warming exceeding K the contribution to GMSLR exceeds m For the largest global warming considered about K the rate of GMSLR is initially mmyr and eventually only a small ice cap endures resulting in over m of GMSLR Our analysis gives a qualitatively different impression from previous work in that we do not find a sharp threshold warming that divides scenarios in which the ice sheet suffers little reduction from those in which it is mostly lost The final steady state is achieved by withdrawal from the coast in some places and a tendency for increasing SMB due to enhancement of cloudiness and snowfall over the remaining ice sheet by the effects of topographic change on atmospheric circulation outweighing the tendency for decreasing SMB from the reduction in surface altitude If late thcentury climate is restored after the ice sheet mass has fallen below a threshold of about m of sea level equivalent it will not regrow to its present extent because the snowfall in the northern part of the island is reduced once the ice sheet retreats from there In that case about m of GMSLR would become irreversible In order to avoid this outcome anthropogenic climate change must be reversed before the ice sheet has declined to the threshold mass which would be reached in about years at the highest rate of mass loss within the likely range of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change We are set to lose enough Antarctic ice to result in several metres of sea level rise from that alone though Here we show that the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits a multitude of temperature thresholds beyond which ice loss is irreversible Consistent with palaeodata we find using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model that at global warming levels around degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels West Antarctica is committed to longterm partial collapse owing to the marine icesheet instability

,"I like these exercises :)

Where did the 25,000,000,000 GWh figure come from out of interest?

According to [this estimate](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/total-electricity-output-gwh-wb-data.html), total electricity generation in 2014 was about 4,300,000 GWh which is much much smaller that your number above. I know you're citing all energy use but it's too far off surely.

[This article ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States) cites

> Primary energy use in the United States was 90,558 petajoules [PJ] (25,155 TWh)

*That's 25 PWh, not 24,000 PWh.*

Anyway, was doing a similar exercise on a thread about solar in Taiwan for some reason. 

I got 2 useful numbers. Nominal power for solar is about 38W/m2 (if you're in India) and capacity factor is 27%.

So going by the Wikipedia number, 25,000,000 GWh, that would need 

25,000,000 / 365*24 = 2,900 GW of continuous generation

So applying the capacity factor, we get 

2,900 / 0.27 = 10,740GW of nameplate generation

So that's 

10,740,000,000,000/38 of area = 
282,000,000,000 m2
= 282,000 km2
= a square of side 530 km

Kinda huge.

Taken a different way, the USA has a land area of 9,384 million sq km2

So 282,000 km2 is 3% of the total land area. It doesn't seem so bad that way somehow. Still a huuuge area, but hey, there's a lot of desert looking for some useful purpose. According to [this article ](https://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/atmospheric/us-desert-50-years1.htm) 

> More than 30 percent of North America is comprised of arid or semi-arid lands, with about 40 percent of the continental United States at risk for desertification

Btw, Taiwan's number was 3.6%.

Oh, and of course you would also need a huuuge amount of storage to capture and deliver the energy when it's needed.

But, just another thing to mull over. if you had 100 million EVs each with 50KWh of storage and a decent V2G system, that would provide 5,000,000,000 KWh of storage, or 5,000 GWh of storage, against the 2,900GW of generation mentioned above.

No idea how the battery industry will crank out that storage anytime soon, and the V2G won't be nearly efficient to just suck up and deliver that power whenever needed.

But hey, there's also wind which is negatively correlated with solar (it's more windy when the sun isn't at its strongest, and it blows at night just fine)....",I like these exercises Where did the GWh figure come from out of interest According to this estimate total electricity generation in was about GWh which is much much smaller that your number above I know youre citing all energy use but its too far off surely This article cites Primary energy use in the United States was petajoules PJ TWh Thats PWh not PWh Anyway was doing a similar exercise on a thread about solar in Taiwan for some reason I got useful numbers Nominal power for solar is about Wm if youre in India and capacity factor is So going by the Wikipedia number GWh that would need GW of continuous generation So applying the capacity factor we get GW of nameplate generation So thats of area m km a square of side km Kinda huge Taken a different way the USA has a land area of million sq km So km is of the total land area It doesnt seem so bad that way somehow Still a huuuge area but hey theres a lot of desert looking for some useful purpose According to this article More than percent of North America is comprised of arid or semiarid lands with about percent of the continental United States at risk for desertification Btw Taiwans number was Oh and of course you would also need a huuuge amount of storage to capture and deliver the energy when its needed But just another thing to mull over if you had million EVs each with KWh of storage and a decent VG system that would provide KWh of storage or GWh of storage against the GW of generation mentioned above No idea how the battery industry will crank out that storage anytime soon and the VG wont be nearly efficient to just suck up and deliver that power whenever needed But hey theres also wind which is negatively correlated with solar its more windy when the sun isnt at its strongest and it blows at night just fine,336,efficient needed mull lot like exercise desert similar useful need semiarid btw article still million side come evs vg much wikipedia thats anytime wont capacity isnt north wind states wm theres total pj amount different night purpose also numbers another thing know oh comprised solar taiwans industry kwh gw anyway provide use youre united nearly petajoules risk nominal way negatively usa deliver sq fine cites exercises interest surely area square electricity hey would going idea citing system doesnt india reason soon energy taken estimate land thread blows bad desertification km power smaller according lands sun america looking gwh far battery seem continental number nameplate pwh crank suck applying capture whenever twh factor percent storage got decent course continuous taiwan huuuge somehow generation get correlated huge primary strongest windy figure mentioned kinda arid

I don't think you fully appreciate the amount of power that would need to be transmitted. Existing transmission lines are not at all up to the task.

Why aren't solar and wind energy better options?

The intermittency and unpredictability of solar and wind are very serious issues. Our entire energy infrastructure is based around the idea that supply ramps up and down to match demand, but solar and wind just give you what you get, often in daily or yearly cycles or just totally unpredictably. It's often more useful to think of energy as a service rather than a commodity. In that sense then how much would you value a mains water supply which sometimes runs dry for a week, or an internet provider which only connects during the daytime?

Mitigating intermittency with large-scale energy storage is arguably a harder problem than generating the energy in the first place. Take a look at this table of energy stored per kg in various types of material. You can see that LNG stores over 60 times the energy per kg than a Lithium-ion battery does, and Uranium stores 92 million times more per kg! The discrepancy in energy density comes from the fact that different fundamental physics processes are involved (in order of increasing storage density: electromagnetism for a capacitor, electrochemical potential for a Li-ion battery, chemical bonds for combustible fossil fuels, and the strong nuclear force for Uranium.) You can't do anything about this because that would first require an enormous breakthrough in fundamental physics or materials science.

What does this imply? This is a bit simplistic, but imagine that the UK experiences a week of low winds in the middle of winter, so they aren't getting much solar either. In that time the UK has demanded maybe roughly 7 TWh of electricity. That's 25 Peta-Joules of electricity. Which sounds easier: having 28 million tons of Li-ion batteries on standby or burning 300kg (roughly the weight of 1 Grand Piano) of extra Uranium? No-one has solved this problem on a big scale anywhere yet. Musk's battery storage facility in Australia has a capacity of 129MWh, so you would need 54000 of those facilities to cover the UK for a week.

Renewables might be able to work better in places that can build their energy infrastructure in tandem with the renewable sources, but that's no help for all the world's major emitters, who have already built their hugely expensive infrastructure.

Intermittent sources also get less cost-effective at higher market penetration. For example if it's a super sunny, and everyone has solar panels giving them loads of electricity, then your solar panels are worth less right now, because no-one wants to buy the energy they produce. I sometimes see headlines like ""solar is now so cheap the cost is sometimes negative!"" but that is clearly inefficient, you would never brag about having to pay someone else to take away all the excess food you bought.

Although the cost of solar panels and wind turbines will fall further, there are fundamental physics limits which stop their energy-production efficiency increasing drastically. They might give you 20% more energy per square metre in the future but they will never give you 10x as much energy per square meter. See the Shockley-Quiesser limit and Betz's law.

When you calculate just how much space would be used up by the renewables capacity required to supply entire countries, they start to look silly. For example, to power the whole UK with just wind turbines would take an offshore wind farm one-third of the size of Wales.

Finally, all renewables are in some way geographically-limited. That's fine for countries like Iceland or Bhutan, who are blessed with plenty of hydro potential, and at least Saudia Arabia would get the most out of any solar panels, but it means that the most efficient global setup would be to have some countries rely upon recieving most of their power from a few others.

,"The reasoning behind placement at a single location is likely the overhead costs associated with each additional solar farm. Not to mention, there are not very many places that could produce 2000 hours per year of sunlight at 1 kW per m^2. Distribution will always be an issue with solar.

Having said that, there are some big and very fundamental issues with HVDC. The article you posted does not cite any sources or provide any data related to the so-called break even point, so I find it very suspect. Also, that break even assumes neither already exists, which is not the case, so there is a huge net loss equaling the cost of the preexisting AC lines. Additionally, they point out that a major disadvantage of HVDC is ""Uncontrollable power flow"" which brings us back to storage as a major issue. That, and I believe the diagram from the OP obviously did not account for a major restructuring of infrastructure of the entire power grid. This is not cheap.

,"If I could reply to your comment in one word it would be: Worth.

I don't know why you're hammering the wildlife habitat thing, it's practically a non-issue. We would probably place at least 2/3 of the panels on roofs of existing buildings. ~~And it's not like solar panels really screw up habitats. We're not plowing down rainforests, just mounting the panels on some supports on flat ground in the middle of nowhere and creating shade underneath. Oh no.~~ <--- OK I was wrong about this. But still, worth.

The point I most agree with is having to dig and lay more electrical lines. This would still be worth it. It'd be crazy expensive and more destructive than erecting the panels themselves but after it was all said and done the infrastructure would be set and ready to go for decades upon decades.

Schlepped to the NE? Electricity travels near the speed of light. Yes obviously solar panels are made by mostly coal power. That wasn't a real question, it went along with my next rhetorical question right after. That's the only way to build them as of now unless some 100% renewable solar manufacturer comes along. But the more solar in the world the less coal powers our everyday needs. How the hell are we ever going to achieve 100% renewable energy without some carbon cost? We aren't. But there isn't any better way to spend that carbon cost than on the road to renewable energy.

80% output over 20 years is nearly negligible, 80% after 20 years is very good. By that time we'd have more than enough clean energy from those solar panels to cover the manufacturing for the 20% decrease.

I mean what's the alternative? We just keep going with coal and oil with no push for solar/wind because it'd be expensive and damage the environment a bit? Better to eventually hit 100% renewable at a low carbon cost than keep going with our current shit show of a situation with coal and oil powering everything, polluting every day.",If I could reply to your comment in one word it would be Worth I dont know why youre hammering the wildlife habitat thing its practically a nonissue We would probably place at least of the panels on roofs of existing buildings And its not like solar panels really screw up habitats Were not plowing down rainforests just mounting the panels on some supports on flat ground in the middle of nowhere and creating shade underneath Oh no OK I was wrong about this But still worth The point I most agree with is having to dig and lay more electrical lines This would still be worth it Itd be crazy expensive and more destructive than erecting the panels themselves but after it was all said and done the infrastructure would be set and ready to go for decades upon decades Schlepped to the NE Electricity travels near the speed of light Yes obviously solar panels are made by mostly coal power That wasnt a real question it went along with my next rhetorical question right after Thats the only way to build them as of now unless some renewable solar manufacturer comes along But the more solar in the world the less coal powers our everyday needs How the hell are we ever going to achieve renewable energy without some carbon cost We arent But there isnt any better way to spend that carbon cost than on the road to renewable energy output over years is nearly negligible after years is very good By that time wed have more than enough clean energy from those solar panels to cover the manufacturing for the decrease I mean whats the alternative We just keep going with coal and oil with no push for solarwind because itd be expensive and damage the environment a bit Better to eventually hit renewable at a low carbon cost than keep going with our current shit show of a situation with coal and oil powering everything polluting every day,333,went solarwind manufacturing polluting ever clean wrong like show rhetorical nonissue lines speed screw ground yes still near everyday everything day done plowing manufacturer bit thats light powers wildlife better made cost nowhere alternative isnt unless needs buildings dont existing wasnt build creating mean destructive comment hell ne next thing know along oh solar upon comes underneath question time one youre ready world nearly less way worth habitat good expensive achieve could spend infrastructure low least environment powering electricity shade would going mostly probably go eventually situation supports dig set every wed cover roofs practically energy hit word place electrical schlepped lay renewable agree travels power mounting right coal push road really reply erecting decrease without years decades real said flat damage crazy middle output obviously enough whats ok habitats arent rainforests keep oil panels shit hammering negligible current itd point carbon

Five years ago I would have agreed with you, but the costs of renewable power are dropping so quickly that investing in new nuclear (which would come online in ~2030 at the earliest) seems not as vital anymore, though an increase in baseload would still be nice.

,"**Pumped-storage hydroelectricity**

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing.  The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power.

,That’s kind of a straw man from what I was saying. Gas has a transitional role in a world where renewable and storage (ITC) subsidies are phasing out and fossil fuel and nuclear subsidies are not. I’m not a proponent of nat gas but nuclear can’t happen fast enough to play the transitional role that gas is and since it’s so baseload oriented it also doesn’t solve for intermittency. Storage + renewables will replace gas before new nuclear technology is market ready and financeable (outside of just dropping on rate payers perhaps) and subsequently constructed and operational. And why is wind and solar so carbon intensive in your mind relative to nuclear? Everything I’ve heard is manufacturing lifecycle.

*Very* interesting observation.

>I was wondering how the public felt about things.

In the US, I don't think the idea of CO2 reduction as a panacea has gained much traction among the general public. My sense is that most people here conclude, mostly accurately, that they have little connection to or influence over the global climate and global anthropogenic trends. But in other countries, with smaller or more easily-swayed populations, views could be very different.

The forum takes a pretty laissez-faire attitude toward troll-like contributions, so it's up to each individual participant to filter out trolls to their own satisfaction, or else find another solution. I encourage you not to be put off by that here, though — there are still plenty of people who are genuinely interested in the actual facts and analysis in climate science.

,"Ok, well, here are my opinions about the current state of affairs:

* A warmer climate will have more weather, which in general affects costal cities and areas prone to flooding.  Some countries, like the Netherlands, who are used to dealing with water, are already taking measures to beef up their dikes, etc.  
* A warmer climate will have sea level rise, the amounts which are debateable, but here I would plan for the worst estimates.  This is a very real agreeable consequence of a warmer climate.
* A warmer climate is a wetter climate, not a dryer climate.  Places like the Middle East, Africa, and the Western US, will receive more fresh water.  However, people don't really seem to care about these areas, so this is usually considered a minor point.
* I do not believe, having been raised on a farm and having knowledge of advanced agriculture, that our food supply will ever be in jeapordy with a warmer climate.
* Going ""Carbon Neutral"" is a non solution, since people and governments lack the will to do what it takes.  While there is popular support for these initiatives in Europe, I do not think they understand what each person will have to give up to achieve this.  And I certainly think that Americans do not have the popular support.  Nor will India or China do more than give this lip service.  
* So to me, when people say ""We should play it safe"", I think geoengineering is the only solution.  Any one country can do it, you dont have to rely on any other countries support (of course another country may use force to stop you).  Reflective aerosols in my opinion would be the easiest and best choice.  Mind you, I am not advocating for this, I am just saying that if the political will can be generated that actually wants to take concrete measures to drop global temperatures, areosols would be immediately effective and do not require world concensus to deploy.
* Nor do we have the will to switch to nuclear energy, which would go a long ways towards solving global warming.  We DO understand nuclear, the risks and benefits FAR better than we understand climate science.  Ergo, the fear of climate change must be less than the fear of nuclear power, which to me is irrational if you do even a cursory study of nuclear power and why it has gotten such bad press.

That’s not how it works.  You need to first show that the hypothesis of Anthropogenic global warming is valid.  This is done through repeated and verified experimentation and direct observation, not through anecdotal and circumstantial evidence that is then worked backwards through computer models designed to show CO2 is causing warming.  You need to show that a rainstorm or hurricane or flood or drought would have been less severe or not happened at all if not for human emitted CO2.    

Show me how empirical evidence ether supports AGW.  Show me the independently verified experiments that confirm AGW.  Show me the direct observations confirming AGW.

,"Please elaborate your statement with legitimate and up-to-date information. I'd love to hear why you're so ignorant about these insanely dangerous hazards that will have a major impact on all countries.

I surely hope you realize how big of a threat climate change is to us humans.

So again, please provide solid and recently updated information to support your 'theory', and provide us the source(s) AKA links.

And at last, before you claim that it is fake news once again, please read:
There are many wildfires erupting in multiple areas, take a look at Canada, Australia, Greece, America and Russia. These dont even scratch the surface of how many forest fires there are, except for the ones in Russia. In Russia, a forest roughly as big as India is currently being burned down. The fire has already burned down 1.5 million hectares (3.7m acres). Thats absolutely insane. Theoratically you could say the lungs of the earth are slowly getting burned away.
The Russian goverment was not willing to do anything about it because it would've costed too much money. Right now other countries are supplying locals with aid, and pressuring Russia to do more about it. Trust me, you'd be crying if you saw these comments denying the fires, just after your city(and possibly family) got scorched.
Now excuse me, I hate to be a pessimist, but I really see no chance for survival anymore. These raging fires are burning our existing oxygen, then destroying our source of oxygen, and at last they also speed up climate change.
Leaving massive amounts of smog behind, these wildfires are encouraging more deadly events to happen.

Personal Rant(please excuse me):
I honestly hate to see people like you. They just deny actual facts that have to be taken seriously. People are dying in massive quantities and so is the planet. We really can't keep being so ignorant.
Worst thing about these people: they've got to see it with their own eyes to believe it. Nothing can prove them otherwise, I hope this is an exception.

Instead it ends on a bittersweet note. Everyone survives, but they're not in a totally good spot. The movie then ends with a speech about how most things are bad, but some things are good, and the final line is a toast ""To our survival.""

,"Sure, I will share what I know for France, I will just share the sectors I personally know  but I know for a fact Germany is following a very similar course. 

Construction: check out RT 2021 (which is a big ass 100 document pdf which see the legislation for new buildings) which just came out this year and forces the whole industry to change drastically all of It's construction methods. (Switch from conqurete frame houses to wood one, made it mandatory for all new construction projects to be energy positive. That makes it very hard to use conqurete as conqurete emit a lot of CO2, so new constructions will favor wood. Here are a few exemples. One in germany. [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/xVssUUUukywQkdsR6)

One in France [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/wPZA28v6UB5zHXuq9)

Architects in France and Germany (again not sure for other countries) now have to present a carbon a summary of carbon emission generated by the materials and the construction. The whole project has to be neutral or positive in order to be approved which forces a global change in the industry. 

Automotive: All european car manufacturer have a very very strict maximum emmision when designing new cars. If it is anything above set treshhold they pay around 80euros per Mg of extra CO2. That is massive and pushed some companies out of europe. ( Like Opel and most american companies ) That would rise the prices of the cars by 100% of It's value in many cases. If the new car has an electric version then it is deduced from the pollution allowed for the car using a certain ratio. Up to now this ratio has been ridiculousy high. (Like 1 electric car would compensate for 5 thermal one, but it gave time for the industry to switch ) but the EU is slowly reducing the ratio and pushing the industry toward electric.

,"We will? Because we are feeling disastrous effects right now. How long before it becomes cataclysmic?

Even if we were to stop all GHG emissions right now, those gases will remain in our atmosphere for decades and continue to heat our planet. It would take nearly a hundred years to get where we are now, and that's if we halted all emissions at this very moment.

We are just 0.3 Celcius away from 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average, which is what the IPCC predicted for 2040. These slow progressions towards net-zero may be ultimately too late.  

Forgive me for being a ""doomer"" but how can I look at this situation with any sort of hope? Any sort of promise? Most developed countries are nowhere near reaching their energy transition promises. Plus we can hardly tell the worlds largest GHG emitter to leave the south China sea and stop putting Muslims in concentration camps. How in the sweet fuck are we going to tell them to stop the numerous industries that have just started to form a middle class and 1st world comforts there. Even so, as long as we continue to buy their products our emissions will just shift over from where we live to China just like it's been doing for the past 20 years. Besides, most targets set by industrial nations are just for energy emissions alone. What about transportation emissions? What about animal farming? What about this insatiable need for bigger, better, and faster products? We cannot continue living as developed nations do especially considering most nations can barley transition into mass clean energy. We are unsustainably raping the planet to live a life of luxury that's slowly killing us. Our need for constant quick and convenient products emits an insane amount of emissions. In 2017, Amazon package deliveries ALONE emitted 19 million metric tonnes of carbon.

And say for some magical reason that human-caused climate change didn't exist, what about the total exhaustion of planetary resources? Constant progress isn't finite and is unattainable.

To temper your optimism a touch, Costa Rica’s achievement is due in very large part to its unique geography, which has provided the relatively small nation with relatively large amounts of hydropower.  They have been clever in using that hydropower as cheap ‘storage’ for wind and solar generated electricity (by using excess to pump water into the reservoirs), but few nations - and particularly lager nations - will have the necessary geography and thus hydropower resources to replicate their achievement.

,"Per capita emissions aren't something to be ignored, but they're ultimately still political measures confined by arbitrary borders that the earth doesn't care about one bit.  

Volume is still ultimately the thing that kills the planet.  The top-3 emitters in China, USA, and India still account for nearly half of worldwide emissions.  If they don't get onside, it probably isn't going to matter what anybody else does.  Sheer momentum of mass.

Even if we're not going to take arbitrary political boundaries into account in climate destruction, it's still raw volume that matters.  Where the top 3 emitters still make up the same general areas of high population concentration.

Frankly, if we throw that out, it ends up looking worse by ""region"", because you start lumping Hong Kong and Taiwan (which are top emitters in their own right) in with a ""roughly geographic China region"" that is already exponentially more polluting than anyone else on earth, to form an even more potent ""super emitter region"", even though they're tiny geographic regions being added.

,"I find it troubling that the lead author of the paper has apparently only looked at how often degree Celsius figures were mentioned in the IPCC report. It doesn't take that much knowledge to understand that the IPCC tends to prefer its scenarios (formerly called [Representative Concentration Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway), and now called [Shared Socioeconomic Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways)) to make projections.

To show why this difference matters, I decided to Ctrl-F [the IPCC February report on the impacts of climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_FullReport.pdf) (the most relevant one, since we are talking about how bad it's going to get here, while the first report is basically about the processes causing climate change and the third is how to stop it/adapt to it) to see how often it mentions both degrees of warming and the SSP scenarios across its 3675 pages.

First, the degree search.

* 1.5^(o) C - 17 times
* 2^(o) C - 25 times
* 2.5^(o) C - once
* 3^(o) C - 13 times
* 4^(o) C - 9 times
* 5^(o) C - 2 times

So, it does seem like there's the focus on the best case, right?

Now, let's look at how often it mentions the scenarios.

* SSP1-1.9 - the 1.5 degrees pathway.
* SSP1-2.6 - the \~1.8/well under 2 C pathway. This pathway and the SSP1-1.9 are altogether mentioned 134 times.
* SSP2-4.5 - ~2.7 degrees. The ""intermediate"" pathway. [The one believed to be happening right now](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/). Mentioned 59 times.
* SSP3-7.0 - The pathway which leads to \~4 degrees. The pathway of the highest population growth and the lowest international cooperation. Mentioned 84 times.
* SSP5-8.5 - The hottest pathway, which results in 4.5+ degrees of warming by the end of the century, driven by the absolute highest economic growth. Mentioned 133 times.

So, the pathway of the greatest warming - one considered to be well *above* the most likely present course - is mentioned **more** often than any other pathway, and as often as the two lowest-warming pathways combined. This doesn't exactly scream ""underexplored"" or ""betting on the best case"" to me. I didn't see the lead author or his co-authors discuss this anywhere.

It does not help that in [the actual paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2108146119), the scenarios *are* mentioned at one point, but there's seemingly some confusion. SSP3-7.0 is first called a ""middle-of-the-road"" scenario (which is actually SSP2-4.5), and only later it is described more appropriately as ""a medium-high scenario of emissions and population growth"".

1 and 5 can be more-or-less dismissed outright (essentially an ideal picture of harmonious global development and a suicidal high-pollution rush requiring more fossil fuels [than what may actually exist](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41247-016-0013-9)), so it leaves the other three in the middle, with 2 as the most plausible one still.

This paper below contains a lot of numbers and graphs about what 2050 under 2-4.5 would be like.

However, it is **not** peer-reviewed, and so it allows itself a number of dramatic flourishes. The most notable one is the food security section, which is premised on the idea of global cropland staying constant. In practice, no pathway assumes that: all but SSP1 estimate that the most likely way in which the stresses of climate change on food production will be dealt with is through hundreds of millions of hectares of forest [getting cut down and turned to cropland](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959378016300681-gr4.jpg). As such, the peer-reviewed studies project impacts on food security that are a lot more modest than what you might expect from reading the Chatham House report alone.

Of course, this would inevitably devastate the environment in those places, and this is the key reason why so many species (one million out of eight as the base-case estimate of IPBES; other major groups have estimates closer to 1 species out of 5 or even 3) are projected to be at risk of extinction. So, that is the likely future by 2040-2050. The climate gets unquestionably worse and more disruptive for everybody, but hundreds of millions nevertheless go from extreme poverty to something more like their countries' middle class, and their and our lives are sustained through further encroachment onto the once-undegraded land. Later in the century, this arrangement could come under severe strain if we both fail to electrify farming machinery to any meaningful extent and if oil availability goes down as much as some analyses [show it might](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666049022000524), but the uncertainties here make this more of a speculative scenario for now.

,"No, and this is not my argument, and nor is it the argument I'm responding to. The primary claim advanced by the paper cited in the article is that the worst outcomes of climate change are insufficiently **studied**, and it explicitly claims that the 1.5 and 2 degree worlds are mentioned too often in the scientific literature relative to their likelihood, and there is not enough mention of higher warming.

My little exercise shows that on the contrary, the scenario widely understood to lead to over 4 degrees of warming (SSP5-8.5, formerly RCP 8.5) is mentioned as often as the scenarios associated with both of those figures combined, so this particular claim appears groundless. Indeed, there are plenty of papers which *only* look at the RCP 8.5, and some of them admit that there has not been sufficient research into the other scenarios to enable them to study those as well. i.e.

[https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10274](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10274)

Or

>Data are taken from the Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive, compiled at the National Center for Atmospheric Research from simulations run at modeling centers around the world (7). **All of these ensembles were created using the “high-emissions” Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)**, and four of these models made the appropriate land surface variables available: the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model version 3 (GFDL-CM3), the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2), and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark 3.6 (CSIRO Mk-3.6) (Materials and Methods).  
>  
>**The choice of the RCP8.5 high-emissions scenario for this study was necessitated by data availability, since all available SMILEs employed this scenario in their experimental design. We note, however, that RCP8.5 is regarded by some as an overestimate of projected future warming** (17) and a lower-emissions scenario will project a less extreme set of future changes. Nonetheless, these ensembles represent one of the best available experimental suites to assess the potential range of future hydroclimate changes, and the complete sets of simulations used, including ensemble sizes, are described in SI Appendix, Table S1.

So, these studies provide further proof that RCP 8.5 is often the most-studied scenario, and yet it is often considered an overestimate. Indeed, as I said earlier, the current projections of most likely temperature by the end of the century place it [at \~2.7 degrees](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/), which is well below RCP 8.5 and is almost exactly the same level as RCP 4.5 So, if anything, it is the RCP 4.5 (now SSP2-4.5) that is badly understudied, and  the authors' claim appears groundless.

The other claim made in the paper, that there's not enough attention paid to non-linear interactions, etc. between different impacts of climate change appears more plausible on its surface.

,"I really don't like looking at nation numbers and comparing them like that. It makes it too easy to shift responsibility away. There's always someone else who is a worse offender by some statistic and this is used to justify not having to change a thing. 

For instance: in German debates (i am German), it's often said ""Germany is only contributing 2% of global co2 emissions, what could we do if we change our behavior?"" My answer on that: ""we're only 1% of the world population but contribute 2% of emissions! Don't you see how that is wrong?""

But usually, people really don't want to hear that, because it does what they don't want to hear: it makes them personally responsible. Talking about personal emissions:

> this means that every person on this earth would be entitled to a climate-friendly budget of about 1.5 t CO₂ per year on average in order to reach the maximum warming target of 1.5° C

Source: https://www.atmosfair.de/en/green_travel/annual_climate_budget/

What does this mean? 

A flight from Paris to New York and back: 1.9t co2.

What about cars? 

> A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. 

Source: https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle

I guess it's pretty obvious what that means...

Our life style is unsustainable in the long run, unless we change the emissions drastically. How? Travel by train for instance. The co2 emissions from Berlin to Paris by train: 0.005t. By plane: 0.195t. When pointing that out to people, they'll say ""but taking the train sucks, it's taking so much longer!"". Is that so? Taking the train from Berlin to Paris takes about 9h. The plane takes 6h. Sure win? Well, the train arrives at the center of the city. The plane does not. Getting from the city center to and back, the airports surely adds another 1h. Also, you need to arrive somewhat earlier at the air port for security checks - add another 30 minutes to be sure. So for the fucking convenience of not having to change trains and saving 1.5h - 2h of our time, we deliberately choose to emit 39 times the amount of co2. What. The. Fuck. This is what is wrong with us. 

I actively try to minimize my footprint. I don't have a car and don't fly much (once every 5 years maybe). And what do people tell me when I say I arrive by train? ""Why don't you fly, it's so much more convenient"". I hate this so much. We're in this boat together, but no one wants to pick up the paddles and do their part.

,"USA isn't the #1 contributor by either total emissions or by per capita. Your friend is right.  The USA industrialized much earlier (and in a bigger way) than other individual nations, so the US has more long term cumulative emissions than other nations.  When we're compared with, say, Germany or France or England, nations with the populations analogous to several of our states, our size dwarfs theirs.  When compared with nations late to industrialization, like China or Brazil or India, our early adoption caused us to have more cumulative emissions.  

So, pick and choose which way you want to measure things, and declare carefully before you make claims.  

We are aspiring to have a 50% reduction in emissions (based on 2005 numbers) within the next decade or two.  That would cause our per capita numbers to swap places with China (since they are still growing, and have said that they intend to continue to increase emissions).  With 5 times the population as the US, it won't take long for them to catch up, and be the #1 nation in cumulative emissions, with the US a distant second.

,"You are not wrong; we, in the USA, should absolutely stop importing things from China.  How could we do that?  It would take disincentives, such as ""higher costs,"" right?  Import tariffs, maybe.  Not coming from Biden, of course, since he's best friends with China.

Why do we outsource manufacturing, anyway?  Because it's cheaper to have something made outside the US and shipped in.  Why?  Lots of reasons, but among the reasons are a) labor costs, b) the costs of regulatory oversight, c) the costs of environmental protection enforcement.

I believe it environmental protection.  I believe in having a safe workplace.  I believe in having a living wage.  When we allow nations like China to produce goods for us with low cost labor, with no worker protections and no environmental protection, we get ""importing from China - with CO2 emissions counting as Chinese emissions.""

Border crossing CO2 based tariffs would help fix that - and would also massively raise the cost of Chinese made items, making it more palatable for US based companies to make their items in the US.

,"Ok, listen, every, single, degree matters in ways that you cannot begin to imagine. A single increase in that digit could mean the absolute collapse of entire ecosystems.
I have no idea how to even begin to describe the absolute hell that would unleash if that gauge increased by no more than two digits. Global warming isn’t just warming, it’s the destabilization of natural phenomenons. A single digit of warming means not just a hotter climate, it means dry air, stronger winds, less rain. Basically every single phenomenon gets amplified. Wet areas get wetter, dry areas get dryer. This is a chain of reaction. So when that gauge reads one degree of escalation, that means several digits more of temperature in one place, dryer air, less rain, and so on. If a single mf drops a cigarette in a forest, or someone drops a glass of beer on the ground (that will make the soil burn), the plant will be so dry that the fire is basically unstoppable.

Unfortunately, it's  worse than the lack of accountability. The bigger issue here is that all decisions are distributed: a consumer of bio-fuel cannot know (and, likely, would not care even if he knew) that much about environmental impacts of producing the bio-fuel..

One potential improvement would be to outright prohibit exports/import of biofuel (or at least any such exports/imports should not be labeled as green and should not be eligible for any subsidies). The idea is that both consumers and producers must be in the same jurisdiction and subject to the same laws to expose any environmental costs

,"The situation isn’t quite as bad as you’re making it sound though. Yeah we’ve destroyed a lot of primary forest and ruined many areas, but the planet’s pretty big and there’s still a lot of forested area left. Scientists distinguish between natural forest and plantations: 93% of current forest area is natural, 7% is plantations. The rate of deforestation has decreased since 1990. Some places probably do have more forest cover today than they did in the early 1900s – even though there’s a lot to still do, we’ve come a long way in terms of environmental protection and understanding of environmental economics, forestry, etc. since then. Other places obviously have way less forest cover now than in the early 1900s. Also for the record, biodiversity exists outside of forests too – not saying you’re claiming it doesn’t, but just want to point that out since there’s a tendency to equate nature with forests/trees even though that’s just one type of ecosystem. It’s just not all so black and white all the time.

,"You've demonstrated a genuinely bad ability to understand basic concepts, like 1-1. But I'll leave you with some of the paper, just so that I know you read it:

>The change of El Niño onset regime around the late 1970s is statistically significant. Table 3 shows a 2-way table for testing the statistical significance of the changes of the frequency of occurrence of the 3 types of El Niño before and after the late 1970s. The χ2 test indicates that the regime shift around 1978 is significant at the 99.9% confidence level.

>What has caused the observed change of El Niño regimes? It has been recognized that decadal variations of the background state may have profound impacts on ENSO behavior (17⇓–19). Fig. 4 shows the equatorial background-state changes. The equatorial western Pacific has experienced a significant warming trend coincident with global warming (Fig. 4A) but the central-EP has not. As such, the equatorial zonal SST gradient around the dateline, defined by SSTA (5°S–5°N,135°E–165°E) minus SSTA (5°S–5°N,165°W–135°W), has been enhanced since 1980. Consistent with the increased westward SST gradient, the easterly trade winds near the dateline (150°E–150°W) have also strengthened and the thermocline has shallowed in the past 4 decades with the largest shoaling occurring in the NINO 3.4 (120°W–170°W) region (Fig. 4B), which results from the enhanced easterlies in the CP and the basin-wide wind anomalies (20). This thermocline shoaling together with surface layer warming has substantially increased the vertical temperature gradients (upper-ocean stratification) across the equatorial Pacific.

>These changes in the background conditions over the past 4 decades are arguably favorable for the occurrence of MCP and SBW El Niño events. First, the warming in the western Pacific increases the zonal SST gradients across the dateline, and thus enhances the zonal advective feedback process, which is conducive to El Niño being initiated in the NINO 4 (160°E–150°W) region. This explains why MCP and SBW events tend to occur coincidently and predominantly after the late 1970s. To support this argument, we show, in Fig. 5, that the observed NINO4 SSTA during the El Niño onset phase (April through August) indeed increases with the increasing mean-state zonal SSTA gradient measured by SSTA (5°S–5°N, 135°E–165°E) minus SSTA (5°S–5°N, 135°W–165°W) with a significant correlation coefficient r = 0.85 (P < 0.01). To a large extent, the explanation here is also consistent with the results obtained from coupled climate model experiments (21), in which an initial warming in the western Pacific is associated with strong zonal gradients of mean SST and trade winds in the equatorial CP. Second, the western Pacific warming provides favorable conditions for the Madden–Julian Oscillation (22) events to move into the western Pacific more frequently (23), increasing the frequency of WWBs and thereby the probability of occurrence of SBW events. In addition, the increased vertical temperature gradients strengthen the thermocline feedback, favoring occurrence of SBW events.",Youve demonstrated a genuinely bad ability to understand basic concepts like But Ill leave you with some of the paper just so that I know you read it The change of El Nio onset regime around the late s is statistically significant Table shows a way table for testing the statistical significance of the changes of the frequency of occurrence of the types of El Nio before and after the late s The test indicates that the regime shift around is significant at the confidence level What has caused the observed change of El Nio regimes It has been recognized that decadal variations of the background state may have profound impacts on ENSO behavior Fig shows the equatorial backgroundstate changes The equatorial western Pacific has experienced a significant warming trend coincident with global warming Fig A but the centralEP has not As such the equatorial zonal SST gradient around the dateline defined by SSTA SNEE minus SSTA SNWW has been enhanced since Consistent with the increased westward SST gradient the easterly trade winds near the dateline EW have also strengthened and the thermocline has shallowed in the past decades with the largest shoaling occurring in the NINO WW region Fig B which results from the enhanced easterlies in the CP and the basinwide wind anomalies This thermocline shoaling together with surface layer warming has substantially increased the vertical temperature gradients upperocean stratification across the equatorial Pacific These changes in the background conditions over the past decades are arguably favorable for the occurrence of MCP and SBW El Nio events First the warming in the western Pacific increases the zonal SST gradients across the dateline and thus enhances the zonal advective feedback process which is conducive to El Nio being initiated in the NINO EW region This explains why MCP and SBW events tend to occur coincidently and predominantly after the late s To support this argument we show in Fig that the observed NINO SSTA during the El Nio onset phase April through August indeed increases with the increasing meanstate zonal SSTA gradient measured by SSTA SN EE minus SSTA SN WW with a significant correlation coefficient r P To a large extent the explanation here is also consistent with the results obtained from coupled climate model experiments in which an initial warming in the western Pacific is associated with strong zonal gradients of mean SST and trade winds in the equatorial CP Second the western Pacific warming provides favorable conditions for the MaddenJulian Oscillation events to move into the western Pacific more frequently increasing the frequency of WWBs and thereby the probability of occurrence of SBW events In addition the increased vertical temperature gradients strengthen the thermocline feedback favoring occurrence of SBW events,454,nino onset process like show significance ww extent backgroundstate el behavior maddenjulian enhanced shows minus results background oscillation recognized obtained coefficient near centralep observed ee thus increases increased testing snww sn model statistical explains tend indeed climate occurrence enhances sst paper defined impacts wind feedback shift nio caused winds mean move mcp indicates shallowed also arguably meanstate stratification favoring substantially coincidently largest initiated coupled decadal know late cp easterly layer read argument events types ssta leave fig profound occur ill way phase table concepts upperocean strong favorable coincident initial state r regimes second dateline associated provides consistent temperature ability gradients confidence gradient thereby pacific sbw trade genuinely shoaling anomalies trend past may bad region august vertical around experienced measured conditions variations equatorial enso global change wwbs ew westward across large easterlies decades demonstrated youve western probability statistically frequency test since warming strengthen p changes basinwide understand significant predominantly first support together thermocline increasing april correlation experiments level basic regime b surface addition occurring snee strengthened advective explanation frequently conducive zonal

>You deny what Stefan describes

Nope, only correcting your misconception. He points out that there are multiple modes of heat transfer. He never said that only one can be active at one time, nor did he say that flow in one direction prevents flow in another. In fact, as I've pointed out to you multiple times, he uses the difference between the two directions to calculate the net flow, which you deny he can do. I've even given links to online textbooks that point out that heat is the net flow, but you still deny it.

>depends on the emitter

Nope, energy transfer is bi-directional. Period. Since nothing is at absolute zero, any object will always be transferring energy away from it. But since other things are transferring as well, the total amount depends on the difference between the two. But this is something that's above your ability to comprehend, apparently, since you continue to reject it.

,"Planting trees is like a bandaid for a ruptured vein. You can wrap something around it, but eventually you need to suture it (or whatever the medical procedure is). 

In this analogy, if you suture the vein, you stop CO2 from coming into the system (You're climate Neutral, which is our goal). Though some people even deny the ruptured vein exists, so you won't go to a doctor (peer pressure/democracy). They will probably only be convinced when they slip in the blood, but you keep soaking it up.

So it MIGHT be preferable to wait doing something about the bloodloss just till everyone is convinced we need a doctor.

After that we can fix the bloodloss by planting a lot of trees.

,"Yeah look on a point of semantics I’ll walk back my language for you there. But in reality nuclear waste is a very small overblown issue in an otherwise very good energy source. 

By scalable I refer to the fact that there is a point of diminishing return in building solar and wind farms due to how much space the have to take up to produce the same energy as a nuclear plant, how their location can be difficult to pick, that they cannot provide constant or predictable energy to the grid, that in order use them reliably for power, we’d have to strip mine all of South America for lithium to make enough batteries. Solar and wind are amazing sources of energy when the area permits and the provision of energy from them meets grid demands.

,"It was an arbitrarily stated ratio, however let’s test the quality of this claim. Scroll down any form of the page “hot” “new”... whatever. Count off how many posts are one of these constant repetitious tropes:

-linking a news article that makes the usual “shits all fucked up claim” with the context response pretty much being “haha look at the alarmists they’re so dumb”, with no actual citation of detracting primary evidence or study.

-linking a politician who also has no background in climate science and upholding their opinion as if it represents the reality of climate research. Again, all responses in the form of Symantec or mocking; no citations to primary literature.

-this is one of the rare types of posts: someone posting an old prediction (people made many, many models of prediction and some didn’t work) that’s literally how the scientific process works.

We just need to reach the point where these have all grown elderly and the global population will enter decline. The most cited estimate I've seen is that we'll peak at 11 billion people before the decline. We're almost at 8 billion already.

Now that doesn't help the acute problem that is climate change, but it's not nearly as big of a problem as we think it is.

""The first 10 pages cover the majority opinion. 

My take - Read narrowly, EPA still has authority to regulate carbon emissions from stationary sources, just not on a systemwide basis under existing CAA law. This translates into a political poisoned chalice to regulate power plants with Maximum Achievable Control Technology, such as carbon-capture, regardless of cost. 

Otherwise, I think carbon disclosure, social cost of carbon, and interstate carbon markets are still intact.

,"Before I elaborate, I just want to say that I recently completed a PhD in atmospheric science, and I have several peer reviewed papers on climate related topics. I also work at a lab that develops climate models. 

No climate scientist will disagree that climate change is affecting the _frequency_ of heat extremes. It certainly is. However, you are asking if climate change is affecting a very particular weather event, which is an entirely different question. What climate change is doing to particular weather events is often poorly communicated to the public, in my opinion, due to the challenge of explaining probability in a simple way. I attempt to explain what I mean below, with an analogy...

Imagine you are tossing two coins. When flipping one of the coins, there is a 50-50 chance it lands heads (as should be the case). However, imagine that the other coin is weighted so that there is a 80% chance it goes heads. Both coins can land tails or heads, but the weighted coin will land 80% more often as heads than as tails. So, if you flip both coins _one_ time, there is no way you can tell which coin is the weighted coin. In order to tell which coin is weighted towards heads, many consecutive flips are required.

How is the story above relevant to climate change? Similar to how a single coin toss isn't able to discern which coin is weighted and which is not, a single weather event is not easily attributable to climate change. Furthermore, similar to how many consecutive coin tosses will tell you which coin is weighted and which is not, an entire season or year of weather events may be able to tell you if climate change is occurring. 

In spite of what I wrote above, there are groups doing ""rapid attribution"" studies to try and quantify the impact of climate change on single weather events. It is somewhat debatable, but arguably has merit because we do have physical equations that dictate the evolution of weather. Personally, I am not comfortable with rapid attribution because, try as you might to remove climate change from a weather model, it's not really certain if the sequence of events triggering the weather would have occurred in the same way. How weather evolves is dictated by a set of highly nonlinear differential equations.

There's a lot more on heat waves that I can share here if interested. There's also a podcast series that interviews climate scientists (deep-convection.org). It's rather unfriendly for the general public, honestly, but there are some interesting interviews that touch on questions such as this.",Before I elaborate I just want to say that I recently completed a PhD in atmospheric science and I have several peer reviewed papers on climate related topics I also work at a lab that develops climate models No climate scientist will disagree that climate change is affecting the _frequency_ of heat extremes It certainly is However you are asking if climate change is affecting a very particular weather event which is an entirely different question What climate change is doing to particular weather events is often poorly communicated to the public in my opinion due to the challenge of explaining probability in a simple way I attempt to explain what I mean below with an analogy Imagine you are tossing two coins When flipping one of the coins there is a chance it lands heads as should be the case However imagine that the other coin is weighted so that there is a chance it goes heads Both coins can land tails or heads but the weighted coin will land more often as heads than as tails So if you flip both coins _one_ time there is no way you can tell which coin is the weighted coin In order to tell which coin is weighted towards heads many consecutive flips are required How is the story above relevant to climate change Similar to how a single coin toss isnt able to discern which coin is weighted and which is not a single weather event is not easily attributable to climate change Furthermore similar to how many consecutive coin tosses will tell you which coin is weighted and which is not an entire season or year of weather events may be able to tell you if climate change is occurring In spite of what I wrote above there are groups doing rapid attribution studies to try and quantify the impact of climate change on single weather events It is somewhat debatable but arguably has merit because we do have physical equations that dictate the evolution of weather Personally I am not comfortable with rapid attribution because try as you might to remove climate change from a weather model its not really certain if the sequence of events triggering the weather would have occurred in the same way How weather evolves is dictated by a set of highly nonlinear differential equations Theres a lot more on heat waves that I can share here if interested Theres also a podcast series that interviews climate scientists deepconvectionorg Its rather unfriendly for the general public honestly but there are some interesting interviews that touch on questions such as this,436,spite explaining lot equations similar scientist scientists year wrote share certainly series touch extremes topics flips certain papers develops merit attempt tossing single lab imagine entire isnt model groups climate try honestly story evolution theres analogy mean different quantify completed heads also arguably interested deepconvectionorg relevant say somewhat communicated dictate waves evolves question time events challenge one way podcast atmospheric due interesting however peer want physical furthermore would work season rapid often elaborate phd dictated opinion related poorly set unfriendly heat discern personally science studies impact land may coins sequence lands weather interviews public required many tails recently flipping rather really weighted triggering attribution able order change coin flip case attributable reviewed remove easily affecting asking questions towards probability general debatable frequency consecutive disagree event nonlinear chance two comfortable goes occurring particular tell might differential entirely highly toss tosses explain occurred simple several models

,"Not pretending that I have a better understanding of climate change, but I feel that I need to put things right when it comes to cause and effect, since nobody else does that here. By the way, I really like the analogy of the coins, it is a great way of thinking about how a single event cannot confirm or falsify a pattern of chances.
Climate, however, is an aggregate of weather over a longer period, so as such, a change in climate can never cause a weather event. It is the other way around: many weather events contribute to the climate. As an analogy, in the western world, people have become taller over the last century. Now, this height change did not cause me being taller than both my parents, but me being taller than my parents did contribute to the general height change. It is probably the better and more varied food that made me taller, as it did to so many other people of my generation, which manifested itself in a general height change. Note that there are also some people who are smaller than their parents, but they don't negate the general trend towards taller people, nor the presumption that better and more varied food causes height change over the generations.
So, the question is whether the cause of the climate change, which has to be CO2 emission and all that, is also the cause of the current heat wave. Now here is where the analogy with the coins would fit. 
It is the same sort of question whether a long time smoker got his lung cancer from his smoking habits. You can't be sure for a single case, but in a group of smokers lung cancer is way more frequent than in a group of non-smokers.

I would also say that we can definitely and probably will “fix” this in our lifetimes, and it’s not unlikely that various technologies will continue to be developed that help to stabilize the climate (carbon capture and storage with/without bioenergy production, etc.).

,"Purely from a statistics point of view, I couldn't say one way or the other without looking at more data.

From a physics point of view, however, I think it's justifiable to say that for any given day, warm or cold, the temperature is warmer than it would otherwise be if carbon dioxide and other GHGs were at preindustrial levels instead of 420 ppm. In other words, if the exact same weather systems were moving through Europe today, but the carbon dioxide was at preindustrial levels, it would probably be cooler by perhaps a few degrees Celsius.

,"Basically air rotates clockwise around high pressure and counterclockwise around low pressure due to the Coriolis effect balancing the pressure gradient force (this is called geostrophic balance). So when La Nina produces high pressure off the west coast of the US, the air rotates around it clockwise. Clockwise rotation around this high pressure leads to winds from the south over the central North Pacific, causing warming there, and winds from the north over western North America, causing cooling there (which includes Seattle). Wind from the north causes cooling because it's basically moving Arctic air into your location. Wind from the south causes warming because it's basically moving tropical air into your location.

High and low pressure centers are typically about 3000 km wide or thereabouts, and lows and highs move around the atmosphere all the time, usually west to east in the jet. That's really what causes day-to-day changes in weather.

,"Climate change, without a shadow of a doubt, causes an increase in the _frequency_ of heat waves. This is absolutely true. And, this is similar to how smoking causes an increased probability of lung cancer. But saying climate change caused an increased frequency of heat waves is different than saying that climate change caused a particular heat wave on the date June 17, 2022. I will concede that some climate scientists will disagree with my perspective (the field is a bit split on how to deal with the issue of weather event attribution). I personally fall more in the camp that individual weather events shouldn't hastily be attributed to climate change. Perhaps detailed analysis can lead to a convincing argument, but it often followed by criticism.

I'm going to try to get you to think about this from a scientist's perspective. If you were to try and answer the question, did climate change cause the heat wave on June 17, 2022, how would you do it? If you are like me, you would start with a thought experiment. In order to figure out if climate change affected the weather on precisely the date June 17, 2022, you might consider a hypothetical scenario in which additional carbon dioxide and GHGs weren't emitted and the industrial revolution basically did not happen. An issue becomes evident pretty quickly upon playing out the thought experiment further,  if you have an understanding of the butterfly effect... If you didn't have the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is definitely the case that the weather on the date June 17, 2022 would be different than it was with the additional carbon dioxide, but weather is governed by an _extremely_ chaotic system of differential equations, so this is basically guaranteed. For example, you can also remove a butterfly from planet Earth today and the weather would also be entirely different a few weeks from now than it otherwise would have been if the butterfly were kept on planet Earth. Obviously butterflies aren't causing heat waves.

Because of the chaos in the Earth system, I find questions about how climate change is affecting individual weather events difficult to think about. It's overall difficult to address the question that is being asked in this thread. Some scientists are trying to do it, but the methods are really targeting a different approach, which instead of considering a world without the industrial revolution, is forced to think of the current world and closely examine the physics behind each individual weather event. 

As I said somewhere else in this thread, I think it's fair to say that any day, warm or cold, is warmer than it would otherwise be if carbon dioxide were at lower levels. Beyond this, it's just quite a bit tedious to figure out the exact relationship between the weather on June 17, 2022 and rising GHGs, because statistics can't be employed and considering a world without the industrial revolution is complicated, not that useful. It's much easier to look at the overall statistics. That's why I prefer to limit definitive conclusions to how the overall frequency has changed, rather than just one weather event, unless a very convincing physical argument is made.

,"Nope. I'm not in Seattle. I asked because it affects my answer to your question.

In Seattle during winter, it's cold during sunny days and warm during cloudy days because when the wind is from the east, you move relatively warm air from the ocean onshore into Seattle. This makes it cloudy too, because air overlying ocean has a lot of water vapor in it, that condenses and forms clouds when encountering topography. Conversely when the wind is from the west, it will be sunny because the air is drier and has less water vapor. But air from the interior of the continent is colder. 

So basically in Seattle, it will be colder in winter when the wind is from the east, because that brings in air from the interior of the continent. But it will be warmer when the wind is from the west because that brings in air from over the ocean (which stays warm over winter). Air from the ocean makes clouds, so warm weather will be cloudy weather.

Interestingly the article quotes many sections of the book, but doesn't actually refute any of them. It's as if the author of the article hasn't actually read the book:

>His teaser for Chapter 7 is an equally troubling misdirection. He promises to highlight “some points likely to surprise anyone who follows the news—for instance, that the global area burned by fires each year has declined by 25 percent since observations began in 1998.” Global statistics are meaningless in this context. Wildfires (if that is what he is talking about) are local events whose regional patterns of intensity and frequency fit well into risk-based calibrations because they are increasing in many locations. Take, for example, the 2020 experience. Record wildfires were seen across the western United States, Siberia, Indonesia and Australia (extending from 2019) to name a few major locations.

Koonin addresses this, talking about the impact of forest management being conflated with climate change as a driving force behind wildfire trends.

,"Finish reading:

>Take a more specific example. From August through October of 2020, California suffered through what became the largest wildfire in California history. It was accompanied by the third, fourth, fifth and sixth largest conflagrations in the state’s history; and all five of them were still burning on October 3. Their incredible intensity and coincidence can only be explained by the confluence of four climate change consequences that have been attributed to climate changes so far: record numbers of nighttime dry lightning strikes during a long and record-setting drought, a record-setting heat wave extending from July through August, a decade of bark-beetle infestation that killed 85 percent of the trees across enormous tracks of forests, and long-term warming that has extended the fire season by 75 days.

>So, what is the takeaway message? Regardless of what Koonin has written in his new book, the science is clear, and the consensus is incredibly wide. Scientists are generating and reporting data with more and more specificity about climate impacts and surrounding uncertainties all the time.

,"""The consensus is incredibly wide,"" but not in agreement with the forestry commission themselves. This forest management argument is not unique to Koonin. There is a consensus on it; a policy of fire suppression has prevented smaller more frequent fires burning off light deadwood layers. Fires are part of a forests natural lifecycle, and always has been. Indeed I believe forest fire size and intensity are down in regions where this policy has been reversed.

I don't refute the idea that average higher temperatures, or a longer drought season have *also* contributed to your wildfire issue, but like Koonin says all of these things fall into natural variability and due to the short timespan of the observed behaviours it's important to be reserved in making grand conclusions.

The point of Koonin's book is that whilst a net increase in temperature anomaly is observed, the time period compared to the duration of cyclic climatic behaviour makes it very difficult to isolate the anthropogenic signal from the feedback loops  between CO2, aerosols, heat etc; that ultimately control temperature anomaly. Therefore drastic actions to reduce CO2 output at the expense of economic growth and working/lower class peoples' wellbeing are hasty, and attempts to understand how best to adapt are more suitable. What evidence contradicts this? Like actual papers or books written by hard sciences professors/researchers and whatnot, not cute popular ""science"" web articles.

,"Is there evidence that climate change and zoonotic diseases have a common cause?

What does the evidence say is the common cause of both?  That common factor needs to be addressed in addition to directly tackling climate change. 

Perhaps human destruction and degradation of natural habitats is leading to mass species extinctions, climate change, and zoonotic infectious diseases.

Also, bear in mind, there are other, much more deadly viruses out there. MERS death rate around 35%. SARS 9.5%.

,"it's going to manifest in a similar pattern of noticeable occurrences to a pandemic virus where it will start out bad but seemingly isolated, and then, suddenly, your property is on fire/flooded/etc etc. 

I basically live outside the world as a result of seeing pure devastation after a long marine heatwave. We're not talking about sudden death, we're talking an exponential thinning of life.

Even in the 90's, it was like diving into life itself. There were no meaningful boundaries between individuals because the space between would be filled with increasingly smaller forms of life. It was like jumping into sunlight for me as a kid. I'd study the tidal pools and the smaller critters I could see with my microscope. I've tried to write it off as a memory embellished over time but I remember a different world entirely. One where a person had to learn to be careful of life or be stung by it. Now it's all rocks and bottom feeders and the water looks and feels dead. That space between that used to feel so full of life, feels like distant souls wandering in purgatory. Empty water between them. 

We're giving up and taking the one thing nature can't afford to lose; energetic continuity. There are no backups for a system that's worked perfectly for a million+ years and nothing adapts to conditions it hasn't been exposed to. The weaker links fail first, then the species they feed partially starves until it also goes. 

if a jenga tower could only ever be played once and then would cease to exist, would you continue to play after you realized your game would mean your next move could mean the potential end of the game's existence? I can't justify the cost and don't really see the benefit. Technology really isn't that great. We've traded quality for quantity and the second container shipping gets disrupted, we'll have 4 years before we're back to the stone age because everything will have broken.

Believe me, I hate it more than anyone. I lost myself in the emptiness of that ocean. Part of me is stuck down there, screaming into the void, realizing ""this is global"". I don't know what to do with that knowledge or pain. It's so much more than a personal loss, it's like watching someone take an eraser to the sky.

What we've already given up is completely inexcusable. What we're about to lose in a flash is everything else. Just like a virus, it wont be your problem, until it seems like it's only your problem. 

How anyone can participate in this doomsday machine I don't understand anymore. It's like picking slavery over freedom, in the instincts that are wasted in this world we built and torment us in the stasis of our surrounding (hence fashion). We miss nature and being surrounded by life. That's all we're supposed to be doing. That's all there's a budget for. Eating and fucking but nothing else, and especially not fossil fuel powered industry. No shit it advances technology and fast! it's literally concentrated time! We're burning time to get ahead. It's absurd. We're not actually accomplishing anything because we're spending 100k years worth of fuel to advance 100k years of tech but we have all those emissions, released over a decade, completely overwhelming the plants' and sun's ability to fix/absorb that extra carbon. The concentration of CO2 wouldn't be going up if plants were able to keep up. And what is ANY of this for? We eat terrible food, do menial jobs that make no sense or train robots to do the jobs that do make sense... We killed ourselves to rebuild a nature that couldn't hurt us because it wasn't alive, but we never realized that our fear of the dark and the wild wasn't from the wild, it was from us, and we brought it with us. All stuff is trash or will be trash at some point. We kill each other over trash, that we've killed the planet to ""have"" (either it breaks or you die, nothing is forever, so what the fuck are we collecting for? did anyone prepare for any of the climate issues we've had so far? Doesn't seem like something we're going to be good at preparing for so we should stop trying to buy for the end). 

I know there's no other way to feed all these people, but I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I want to spend what days there are left trying to help life where I can, and make amends for a species that forgot itself. Be there at the bedside of the ocean when the last of its infinite hearts stops beating and it becomes a meaningless chemical soup. Monstrous and horrifying existence our species has chosen, The only animal with the power to vocally appreciate the beauty of nature are the only ones threatening it with every move we make.

"Climate change is unimportant, is it? I live in NSW Australia. I feel every day like I'm living in an apocalypse film."," I live in NSW, Australia. We are on fire, and have been for weeks.

Today has been covered in smoke cloud. You can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. It looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. I look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. Not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. It has been for days. The afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.

Today was 39 degrees Celsius. The winds have picked up. The firefighters have been at it for over a month. Over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. Huge portions of it are now soot black. You look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. People have lost their lives. People have lost their homes. The devastation of wildlife is huge.

Sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. I watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. My one cat has asthma. I've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. Otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. It's week three of this.

We are in drought. Again. And it looks worse this time. There are parts of NSW where the dams are empty. Truly empty. Dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.

The sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as I try to get to sleep. People who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. I drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. I pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.

It's two weeks to Christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. Places I've been - places I know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. ""I wish you all the luck in the world"" is what I can say to those I know facing it, and what I get back is ""We will stand and defend our home.""

These aren't small fires that burn out in days. These are firegrounds larger than Sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. The hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. The result is a thunderstorm.

You'd think rain would put these fires out. It does not. The ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. The fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. We get floods on top of fires. Sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.

These thunderstorms are unlike any I have ever seen before. People say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. This is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. Early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. And it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. You just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.

Because these thunderstorms start new fires. They put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.

I've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether I'm needed to help evacuate people. I've watched places I know well go up in smoke. I've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like I have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place I live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.

And then there are the arsonists. I'm at a point where I'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. More water that we don't have spent on fighting them. Planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. All because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be ""funny"" or ""cool"".

Outside my window is sepia tones. It isn't usually. Usually it's blue, and an Australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. It seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.

I look at Wollemi National Park on Wikipedia. Only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. Home to Aboriginal heritage sites. Home to a great many things. An amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. Not a word about the fact that it is black.

Never before in my life have I been so tempted to edit a Wikipedia article as I was just to add the salient point: ""*it's on fire""*. There's little of it left. I tried to edit it. I had the sources I was going to cite with me. I don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.

""Climate change?"" they say. ""What climate change?""

I looked at Cape Town, South Africa and thought, ""Thank the fates we have it okay here!""

Now I look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. It's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. That all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen.",I live in NSW Australia We are on fire and have been for weeks Today has been covered in smoke cloud You can see

,"I am curious if anyone here could explain the fire history in NSW. For the longest time people agressively put out fires in the united states.

We created these tinderboxes and now with higher average temps they seem to be getting that extra boost.

I'm just not sure what we should do. We could agressively start fighting fires again, but I wonder if that would only make things worse. Wildland firefighting is the front line of climate change and we only kind of know what we're doing.

Unrelated, the United States pays our fire fighters shit. They deserve more after having to risk their lives because the world couldn't get it's shit together.

,"This is generally a good post. Fires are a very complicated matter and not necessarily an outright indicator of impending climate change issues specifically.

I lived in a very fire-prone area; there were always fires but some years were particularly awful. Same stuff AUS was experiencing - I think there was about 1.5-2month long fire that made our entire valley feel like a choking chamber because some guy decided that, despite warnings not to, have a small controlled burn on an extremely dry and windy day. That’s it. When it was almost sniffed out, some dipshits in the area went camping and didn’t properly dampen their fire, which then further extended it and made it even worse.

Not contending that drier conditions and fires are a symptom, but they’re also a byproduct of grossly incompetent leadership (many fires in CA), gross incompetence by civilians (the record-setting in Gorge Fire in Oregon in 2016-2017), and of course natural phenomena in an already at-risk environment.

One more time for emphasis, this is from the National Parks Service in the US:

‘Nearly 85 percent* of wildland fires in the United States are caused by humans. Human-caused fires result from campfires left unattended, the burning of debris, equipment use and malfunctions, negligently discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson. Lightning is one of the two natural causes of fires.’

There are more people in the world now and therefore more people that unfortunately don’t understand good conservation practices.

,"Respectfully, I am going to disagree with your post and the spirit of it in particular.  I really think you're looking at things completely wrong, or letting spooky news stories and Reddit echo chambers dictate your outlook.  Obviously AGW will be changing things and we need to stay diligent about its management. (Edit:  I won't be speaking on behalf of Australia, more the US).

Climate change mitigation isn't the tiger that we're waiting to ""just rip our throat out already and end it,"" in fact, it's a tiger that we shanked a good clean knife into, and it decided to run away, we're tracking its blood and is clearly now limping.  Why?

First of all, despite what the Orange Man [wants](https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/10/trump-steps-away-paris-climate-agreement-us-states-cities-and-businesses-step-up) there is actually a ton of work being done in the US.  The world's fifth largest economy has an unprecedented [commitment](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/11/17844896/california-jerry-brown-carbon-neutral-2045-climate-change) towards this.  In just a few short years, we've already gone from a ""very likely"" RCP8.5 scenario to an even [better](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario) outlook. Is 3-4c optimal?  Obviously not.  Are just sitting around with our thumbs up our asses?  You'd be a fool to think so.  I'm not even going to begin raking for news stories about sustainable energy costs vs coal, and even some turning tides on nuclear.

[Corals](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/great-barrier-reef-restoration-transplanting-corals/) are having more and more good news.  [Fires](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-49515462) are actually not markedly worse on a global scale.  There's [compelling](https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/01/Homewood-Hurricanes.pdf) research that would indicate storms are staying relatively in line with their historical trends.  Sea levels are rising at nearly the same [rate](https://climatechangedispatch.com/tidal-gauges-negligible-sea-level-rise/) they have for hundreds of years now.  And there's much more.

I would recommend heading to [happyeconews.com](https://happyeconews.com) or checking out r/climateactionplan \- I see on a daily basis far too many people here on Reddit getting duped into pretty disingenuous, unscientific and outright manipulative articles that are written to generate clicks and not actual scientific discourse of realistic policy interpretations.

Yes, we will warm, extreme events could have an uptick in activity and we'll pay for it - but to take every anomalous event as indicator of climate change is doing the same thing that a skeptic says when they ""record snowfall this last month, checkmate alarmists!""  Extreme events have and will always be an unfortunate but fundamental part of humans living on this wondrous planet.

,"I agree with the sentiment here a lot. 

The media lately seems to almost always be more extreme than the actual science on the issue. 

When I was younger I was really scared that climate change was going to cause all the ecosystems around me and around the world to basically die. 

This caused me to go school and study ecology. As I studied and began working in the field, meeting researchers, reading more, I found more and more that my perspective was becoming more moderated, and that most researchers I met had similar outlooks. 

It's a huge problem that we shouldn't understate. But the bold overstatements in the media don't help either, IMO. 

A few examples as of late. Koalas are functionally extinct due to the fires (they're not). The Amazon fires were far outside of the norm (they were about the same level as a decade ago before stronger protections were put in place. Still a problem but the media should report on it more objectively imo). There is an insect apocalypse (this has been disputed a number of times, and again, while its a problem, is nowhere near as immense and dire as the media reports make it seem). The permafrost is likely to all melt during our lifetimes (its not. The reality of the melt situation is much more long term, and likely won't all melt. Yet again its still a significant problem). 

In each case there are real, and serious issues. But they are reported on in such an extreme way that it drives people to become totally despondent, depressed, and to believe that the world is literally going to end. This to me is an opposite pole of unscientific thinking which also hampers our ability to act effectively on the issue. (Because if nobody can even imagine a likely future, and just think that we're all doomed anyway, then why even try?).",I agree with the sentiment here a lot The media lately seems to almost always be more extreme than the actual science on the issue When I was younger I was really scared that climate change was going to cause all the ecosystems around me and around the world to basically die This caused me to go school and study ecology As I studied and began working in the field meeting researchers reading more I found more and more that my perspective was becoming more moderated and that most researchers I met had similar outlooks Its a huge problem that we shouldnt understate But the bold overstatements in the media dont help either IMO A few examples as of late Koalas are functionally extinct due to the fires theyre not The Amazon fires were far outside of the norm they were about the same level as a decade ago before stronger protections were put in place Still a problem but the media should report on it more objectively imo There is an insect apocalypse this has been disputed a number of times and again while its a problem is nowhere near as immense and dire as the media reports make it seem The permafrost is likely to all melt during our lifetimes its not The reality of the melt situation is much more long term and likely wont all melt Yet again its still a significant problem In each case there are real and serious issues But they are reported on in such an extreme way that it drives people to become totally despondent depressed and to believe that the world is literally going to end This to me is an opposite pole of unscientific thinking which also hampers our ability to act effectively on the issue Because if nobody can even imagine a likely future and just think that were all doomed anyway then why even try,318,disputed thinking dire issue report lot younger similar reported depressed media norm still term near make hampers fires koalas become put much theyre wont imagine nowhere pole climate meeting immense end try imo dont perspective caused field decade literally also long people even ecosystems insect late doomed die began basically yet anyway effectively world unscientific found reports way becoming extinct due lifetimes met think help cause almost school going go functionally ability situation melt overstatements science lately times outlooks permafrost ecology place agree seems working future around reading likely ago far seem either really totally number drives stronger serious change studied case examples nobody opposite real reality always understate outside actual believe issues sentiment significant scared act extreme shouldnt level researchers huge amazon apocalypse objectively protections despondent moderated bold study problem

Essentially, they wanted to take medical professionals out of the decision making regarding the medical needs of people we locked up, so we could go back to politicians making these decisions, a system that resulted in the deaths of 12 people in Australian detention.

I know this is a climate change subreddit, but these issues are all linked.

The west isn't interested in meeting it's low carbon reduction requirements, let alone the technology transfer and funding towards developing countries that's stuck in a quagmire due to domestic populism. A common narrative that's being pushed is that the great social security of the west is posited on exporting it's pollution to the developing world. Wealthy countries have reached a post industrial age where it's cheaper and easier for them to decarbonize, something there's no accountability for in any carbon reduction economics towards developing countries who have to balance emissions reductions with the shock on their economy.

It seems to be an article of faith among anarchoprimitivists that our hunting-and-gathering ancestors had to work an average of only two to three hours a day, or two to four hours a day ... the figures given vary, but the maximum stated never exceeds four hours a day, or 28 hours a week (average). [1] People who give these figures usually do not state precisely what they mean by “work”, but the reader is led to assume that it includes all of the activities necessary to meet the practical exigencies of the hunter-gatherers’ way of life.
>
> Characteristically, the anarchoprimitivists usually fail to cite their source for this supposed information, but it seems to be derived mainly from two essays, one by Marshall Sahlins (The Original Afluent Society [2]), and the other by Bob Black (Primitive Afluence [3]). Sahlins claimed that for the Bushmen of the Dobe region of Southern Africa, the “work week was approximately 15 hours.” [4] For this information he relied on the studies of Richard B. Lee. I do not have direct access to Lee’s works, but I do have a copy of an article by Elizabeth Cashdan in which she summarizes Lee’s results much more carefully and completely than Sahlins does. [5] **Cashdan flatly contradicts Sahlins: According to her, Lee found that the Bushmen he studied worked more than forty hours per week**. [6]
>
> **In a part of his essay that many anarchoprimitivists have found convenient to overlook, Bob Black acknowledges the forty-hour work-week and explains the foregoing contradiction: Sahlins followed early work of Lee that considered only time spent in hunting and foraging. When all necessary work was considered, the work-week was more than doubled**. [7] The work omitted from consideration by Sahlins and the anarchoprimitivists was probably the most disagreeable part of the Bushmen’s work-week, too, **since it consisted largely of food-preparation and firewood collection. [8] I speak from extensive personal experience with wild foods: Preparing such foods for use is very often a pain in the neck**. It is far more pleasant to gather nuts, dig roots, or hunt game than it is to crack nuts, clean roots, or skin and butcher game — or to collect firewood and cook over an open fire.
>
> The anarchoprimitivists also err in assuming that Lee’s findings can be applied to hunter-gatherers generally. It’s not even clear that those findings are applicable on a year-round basis to the Bushmen studied by Lee. **Cashdan cites evidence that Lee’s research may have been done at the time of year when his Bushmen worked least**. [9] She also mentions two other hunting-and-gathering peoples who have been shown quantitatively to spend far more time in hunting and foraging than Lee’s Bushmen did, [10] and she points out that Lee may have seriously underestimated women’s working time because he failed to include time spent on childcare. [11]
>
> I’m not familiar with any other exact quantitative studies of hunter gatherers’ working time, **but it is certain that at least some additional hunter-gatherers worked a great deal more than the forty-hour week of Lee’s Bushmen**. Gontran de Poncins stated that **the Eskimos with whom he lived about 1939–1940 had “no significant degree of leisure”, and that they “toiled and moiled fifteen hours a day merely in order to get food and stay alive.”** [12] He probably did not mean that they worked fifteen hours every day; but it’s clear from his account that his Eskimos worked plenty hard.

> Among the Mbuti pygmies principally studied by Paul Schebesta, on days when the women did not fetch a supply of fruits and vegetables from the gardens of their village-dwelling neighbors, their gathering excursions in the forest lasted between five and six hours. Apart from their food-gathering, the women had considerable additional work to do. Each afternoon, for example, a woman had to go again into the forest and come back to camp panting and bowed under a huge load of firewood. The women worked far more than the men, but it seems clear from Schebesta’s account that the men nevertheless worked much more than the three or four hours a day claimed by the anarchoprimitivists. [13] Colin Turnbull studied Mbuti pygmies who hunted with nets. **Due to the advantage conferred by the nets, these Mbuti only needed to hunt about twenty hours per week. But for them: “Netmaking is virtually a full-time occupation... in which both men and women indulge whenever they have both the spare time and the inclination.”** [14] The Siriono, who lived in a tropical forest in Bolivia, were not pure hunter-gatherers, since they did plant crops to a limited extent at certain times of the year. But they lived mostly by hunting and gathering. [15] 
>
> **According to the anthropologist Holmberg, Siriono men hunted, on average, every other day. [16] They started at daybreak and returned to camp typically between four and six o’clock in the afternoon. [17] This makes on average at least eleven hours of hunting, and at three and a half days a week it comes to 38 hours of hunting per week, at the least**. Since the men also did a significant amount of work on days when they did not hunt, [18] their work-week, averaged over the year, had to be far more than 40 hours. And but little of this was agricultural work. [19] Actually, Holmberg estimated that the Siriono spent about half their waking time in hunting and foraging, [20] **which would mean roughly 56 hours a week in these activities alone. With other work included, the work-week would have had to be far more than 60 hours**. The Siriono woman “enjoys even less respite from labor than her husband”, and “the obligation of bringing her children to maturity leaves little time for rest.” [21] Holmberg’s book contains many other indications of how hard the Siriono had to work.

> In The Original Affluent Society, Sahlins gives, in addition to Lee’s Bushmen, other examples of hunting-and-gathering peoples who supposedly worked little, but in most of these cases he either offers no quantitative estimate of working time, or he offers an estimate only of time spent in hunting and gathering. If Lee’s Bushmen can be taken as a guide, this would be well under half the total working time. [23] However, for two groups of Australian Aborigines Sahlins does give quantitative estimates of time spent in “hunting, plant collecting, preparing foods and repairing weapons.” In the first group the average weekly time each worker spent in these activities was about 26 1/2 hours; in the second group about 36 hours. But this does not include all work; it says nothing, for example, about time spent on child care, in collecting firewood, in moving camp, or in making and repairing implements other than weapons. If all necessary work were counted, the work-week of the second group would surely be over 40 hours. The work-week of the first group did not represent that of a normal hunting-and-gathering band, since the first group had no children to feed. Sahlins himself, moreover, questions the validity of inferences drawn from these data. [24] Of course, even if occasional examples could be found of hunting-and-gathering peoples whose total working time was as little as three hours a day, that would matter little for present purposes, since we are concerned here not with exceptional cases but with the typical working time of hunter-gatherers. Whatever hunter-gatherers’ working hours may have been, much of their work was physically very strenuous. Siriono men typically covered about fifteen miles a day on their hunting excursions, and they sometimes covered as much as forty miles. [25] Covering such a distance in trackless wilderness [26] requires far more effort than covering the same distance over a road or a groomed trail.

> “In walking and running through swamp and jungle the naked hunter is exposed to thorns, to spines, and to insect pests... While the food quest is differentially rewarding because food for survival is always eventually obtained, it is also always punishing because of the fatigue and pain inevitably associated with hunting, fishing and collecting food.” [27] “Men often dissipate their anger toward other men by hunting. ... Even if they do not kill anything they return home too to be angry.” [28]

> Even picking wild fruit could be dangerous[29] and could take considerable work[30] for the Siriono. [31] The Siriono made little use of wild roots, [32] but it is well known that many hunter-gatherers relied heavily on roots for food. Usually, gathering edible roots in the wilderness is not like pulling carrots out of the soft, cultivated soil of a garden. More typically the ground is hard, or covered with tough sod that you have to hack through in order to get at the roots. I wish I could take certain anarchoprimitivists out in the mountains, show them where the edible roots grow, and invite them to get their dinner by digging for it. By the time they had enough yampa roots or camas bulbs for a halfway square meal, their blistered hands would disabuse them of any idea that primitives didn’t have to work for a living . Hunter gatherers’, work was often monotonous, too. This is true for example of root-digging when the roots are small, as is the case with many of the roots that were used by the Indians of western North America, such as bitterroot and the aforementioned yampa and camas. Picking berries is monotonous if you spend many hours at it.

> Or try tanning a deerskin. A raw, dry deerskin is stiff, like cardboard, and if you bend it, it will crack, just as cardboard will.
>
> In order to become usable as clothing or blankets, animal skins must be tanned. Assuming you want to leave the hair on the skin, as for winter clothing, there are only three indispensable steps to tanning a deerskin. First, you must carefully remove every bit of flesh from the skin. Fat in particular must be removed with scrupulous care, because any bit of fat left on the skin will rot it. Next, the skin must be softened. Finally, it must be smoked. If not smoked it will dry stiff and hard after a wetting and will have to be softened all over again. By far the most time-consuming step is the softening. It takes many hours of kneading the skin in your hands, or drawing it back and forth over the head of a spike driven into a block of wood, and the work is very monotonous indeed. I speak from personal experience. An argument sometimes offered is that hunter-gatherers who survived into recent times lived in tough environments, since all of the more hospitable lands had been taken over by agricultural peoples. Supposedly, prehistoric hunter-gatherers who occupied fertile country must have worked far less than recent hunter-gatherers living in deserts or other unproductive environments. [33] This may be true, but the argument is speculative, and I’m skeptical of it.

> I’m a bit rusty now, but I used to have considerable familiarity with the edible wild plants of the eastern United States, which is one of the most fertile regions in the world, and I would be surprised if one could live and raise a family there by hunting and gathering with less than a forty-hour work-week. The region contains a wide variety of edible plants, but living off them would not be as easy as you might think. Take nuts, for example. Black walnuts, white walnuts (butternuts), and hickory nuts are extremely nutritious and often abundant. The Indians used to collect huge piles of them. [34] If you found a few good trees in October, you could probably gather enough nuts in an hour or less to feed yourself for a whole day. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Yes, it does sound great — if you’ve never tried to crack a black walnut. Maybe Arnold Schwarzenegger could crack a black walnut with an ordinary nutcracker — if the nutcracker didn’t break first — but a person of average physique couldn’t do it. You have to whack the nut with a hammer; and the inside of the nut is divided up by partitions that are as thick and hard as the outer shell, so you have to break the nut into several fragments and then tediously pick out the bits of meat. The process is time-consuming. In order to get enough food for a day, you might have to spend most of the day just cracking nuts and picking out the bits of meat. Wild white walnuts (not to be confused with the domesticated English walnuts that you buy in the store) are much like black ones. Hickory nuts are not as difficult to cack, but they still have the hard internal partitions and they are usually much smaller than black walnuts. The Indians got around these problems by putting the nuts into a mortar and pounding them into tiny bits, shells, meats, and all. Then they would boil the mixture and put it aside to cool. The fragments of shell would settle to the bottom of the pot while the pulverized meats would settle in a layer above the shells; thus the meats could be separated from the shells. [35] This was certainly more efficient than cracking the nuts individually, but as you can see it still required considerable work. The Indians of the eastern U.S. utilized other wild foods that required more-or-less laborious preparation to make them edible. [36] It is hardly likely that they would have used such foods if foods that were more easily prepared had been readily available in sufficient quantity.",Some more paragraphs which did not fit in the

,"Not a scientist, just personal opinion, but it feels like the 2050 demarcation is a somewhat safe guide post for nations but that overall, they’re planning to beat that. I assume when they’re made they factor in current technologies plus projections of advancement, but time and time again we’ve seen price projections of new technologies be too conservative and them in reality being much cheaper (see: solar and in the middle of batteries). 

Also keep in mind that many govts have 2035 carbon free electricity goals, and upwards of 70-80% towards net zero by then.All of that seems super feasible (barring govt incentives and free market momentum, which all roads point go.) 

The only issue is the hard to decarbonize sectors (e.g. industry, planes, etc) and its hard to project with current technologies and new ones not yet out of prototype how quickly those can scale (or how much CDR technologies can ramp up to offset those) — but if both of those fall in line with other clean tech, those industries will develop and flourish quicker than expected and we’ll beat the 2050 targets for sure.

The only real thing that gets in the way is the ongoing degradation of the planet and in turn its affect on global gdp, climate migration, etc —— because depending how severe that all gets, if we know anything about humans, we’ll go into self-preservation- hoarding toilet paper -mode ... that’s my main fear, that we won’t ‘beat the clock’ with new systems and innovation in time for the inevitable climate breakdown that’s coming (and obviously aren’t sure how severe it will be by mid century).",Not a scientist just personal opinion but it feels like the demarcation is a somewhat safe guide post for nations but that overall theyre planning to beat that I assume when theyre made they factor in current technologies plus projections of advancement but time and time again weve seen price projections of new technologies be too conservative and them in reality being much cheaper see solar and in the middle of batteries Also keep in mind that many govts have carbon free electricity goals and upwards of towards net zero by thenAll of that seems super feasible barring govt incentives and free market momentum which all roads point go The only issue is the hard to decarbonize sectors eg industry planes etc and its hard to project with current technologies and new ones not yet out of prototype how quickly those can scale or how much CDR technologies can ramp up to offset those but if both of those fall in line with other clean tech those industries will develop and flourish quicker than expected and well beat the targets for sure The only real thing that gets in the way is the ongoing degradation of the planet and in turn its affect on global gdp climate migration etc because depending how severe that all gets if we know anything about humans well go into selfpreservation hoarding toilet paper mode thats my main fear that we wont beat the clock with new systems and innovation in time for the inevitable climate breakdown thats coming and obviously arent sure how severe it will be by mid century,266,issue clean systems like free quicker roads well scientist targets severe depending ongoing see much thats theyre made gets wont climate hard paper assume batteries weve eg toilet gdp incentives safe net prototype also govt barring degradation humans market somewhat sectors thing know coming super technologies solar affect industry nations mind seen time goals ones yet fear planning breakdown flourish advancement govts plus scale way tech momentum electricity sure go new opinion main thenall innovation demarcation hoarding quickly anything post inevitable industries develop feasible seems selfpreservation conservative mid turn many ramp cdr mode global line planes planet real reality etc towards middle clock obviously factor project offset arent feels overall personal price keep current guide decarbonize cheaper projections expected point zero fall century carbon beat upwards migration

,"It's too late already. The second we started pulling ancient sunlight from the ground it was too late. The imbalance in the carbon cycle is much worse of a problem than the heating. Imagine shifting the concentration of oxygen by 70% either way? Dropping CO2 by 70%? All catastrophic. The only reason we're no acknowledging THIS as catastrophic is that we're in too deep to face it in its entirety. Can't add carbon to a carbon balanced system unless it's over an evolutionary timescale (1-2 ppm per decade)... yet here we are.   


We're going to keep being surprised by things getting worse, as we keep making them worse. Fossil carbon doesn't belong in our world. The more we add, the worse things get. It's that simple. Life only has capacity to stresses its been exposed to - it's how evolution works! There's no built-in capacity for one species to completely alter the chemistry of the atmosphere faster than that change can manifest in the system. And with COVID, we're burning more plastic than ever.   


Hope and optimism are earned through effort and change. As a default state they are purely destructive justifications to procrastinate. Currently, we have no hope.

,"The problem with these sort of articles is they are very alarmist. And also written in an extremely bleak and not productive way.

Let me be clear, climate change is a massive existential threat to us, we all know this. 

However, the problem with alarmist articles (apart from triggering all the doomists on Reddit shouting ‘we’re fucked!) is that they do very little to actually encourage action. There’s growing evidence that doomist reporting is being adopted by fossil fuel lobbyists as an argument to say ‘oh well, stopping isn’t going to help. We’re better off carrying on until science solves it for us’.

This article does seem to be targeted towards the Australian government. Which has required a bit of alarmism recently as their love for coal shows no sign of abating and Aus is likely to suffer much more than a lot of western nations.

One thing that needs to be pointed out, consistently. Is actually the positives of the current changing perception of climate change and the investment in renewables and carbon capture.

Yes, the numbers are painfully low still (+1-2% increases). However what the IPCC and a lot of climatologists agree is that at this stage is that change is going to be fairly small for a while. There’s massive cultural, technological and infrastructural hurdles that need to be crossed before mass adoption can take place. These changes are happening now in many places and are setting up for more widespread adoption 2025+. We can’t just stop coal plants etc, it’s a gradual change.

Another key point is cultural and technological adoption is generally led by the west and China. Hopefully with Biden the US will pick up pace. The key to this is not only that the largest contributors reduce their CO2, but that they provide proof of concept and ease of access for the LEDC’s to adopt them cheaply and en-mass. This is important for nations in Africa especially as they can build mass solar farms that allow them to trade energy with other countries. Helping them economically and reducing CO2 potential in the developing world. 

So TL:DR: this article is alarmist. While the data may turn out to be ok, the tone is unhelpful. When actually doomism is helping the carbon industry. Also there’s a lot of good stuff going on now and experts should work on selling the economic benefits of green energy rather than trying to scare/guilt nations.",The problem with these sort of articles is they are very alarmist And also written in an extremely bleak and not productive way Let me be clear climate change is a massive existential threat to us we all know this However the problem with alarmist articles apart from triggering all the doomists on Reddit shouting were fucked is that they do very little to actually encourage action Theres growing evidence that doomist reporting is being adopted by fossil fuel lobbyists as an argument to say oh well stopping isnt going to help Were better off carrying on until science solves it for us This article does seem to be targeted towards the Australian government Which has required a bit of alarmism recently as their love for coal shows no sign of abating and Aus is likely to suffer much more than a lot of western nations One thing that needs to be pointed out consistently Is actually the positives of the current changing perception of climate change and the investment in renewables and carbon capture Yes the numbers are painfully low still increases However what the IPCC and a lot of climatologists agree is that at this stage is that change is going to be fairly small for a while Theres massive cultural technological and infrastructural hurdles that need to be crossed before mass adoption can take place These changes are happening now in many places and are setting up for more widespread adoption We cant just stop coal plants etc its a gradual change Another key point is cultural and technological adoption is generally led by the west and China Hopefully with Biden the US will pick up pace The key to this is not only that the largest contributors reduce their CO but that they provide proof of concept and ease of access for the LEDCs to adopt them cheaply and enmass This is important for nations in Africa especially as they can build mass solar farms that allow them to trade energy with other countries Helping them economically and reducing CO potential in the developing world So TLDR this article is alarmist While the data may turn out to be ok the tone is unhelpful When actually doomism is helping the carbon industry Also theres a lot of good stuff going on now and experts should work on selling the economic benefits of green energy rather than trying to scareguilt nations,404,economic plants fucked lot stopping sort australian need led well yes existential article shows generally changing still bleak co ledcs consistently encourage important increases pointed bit much hopefully reporting better widespread pick isnt needs climate adopt cultural productive build crossed theres trying reducing solves also alarmism numbers take adoption another largest say thing know developing reduce oh mass key solar experts argument industry nations doomists painfully growing adopted carrying provide one threat world concept way us extremely good however economically low fairly doomism cant written lobbyists especially sign help abating potential love benefits africa going work green action contributors stuff allow fuel enmass trade places setting science doomist investment energy infrastructural place may agree targeted stage perception helping happening apart unhelpful coal clear likely required cheaply turn many scareguilt recently west countries china data seem rather triggering ipcc farms fossil stop change evidence government biden alarmist proof little actually aus renewables etc suffer tone capture towards western reddit positives changes ok selling small technological let gradual hurdles current articles shouting point access pace climatologists ease carbon problem massive tldr

,"“(Problem with alarmism) is that they do very little to actually encourage action.” 

I see this claim posted a lot and it feels intuitively right to me. However, I am wondering if there is actual scientific evidence that says that people who read alarming reports tend to act less. Is is a folk Psychology assumption that we all have or is there actually something behind this claim?

I guess the other side of me thinks that perhaps enough alarmism can also cause people to change their behavior. Like people who get lung cancer and finally stop smoking cigarettes. By your logic, people who get lung cancer from smoking should just keep smoking once the doctor gives them the alarming news, but I know a lot of people have been completely woken up by lung cancer and stoped smoking (of course my sample size is very small).",Problem with alarmism is that they do very little to actually encourage action I see this claim posted a lot and it feels intuitively right to me However I am wondering if there is actual scientific evidence that says that people who read alarming reports tend to act less Is is a folk Psychology assumption that we all have or is there actually something behind this claim I guess the other side of me thinks that perhaps enough alarmism can also cause people to change their behavior Like people who get lung cancer and finally stop smoking cigarettes By your logic people who get lung cancer from smoking should just keep smoking once the doctor gives them the alarming news but I know a lot of people have been completely woken up by lung cancer and stoped smoking of course my sample size is very small,146,scientific also lot little like alarmism people actually wondering guess psychology news actual stoped behavior says know claim enough posted see course perhaps read doctor side cigarettes act logic right smoking small encourage feels less something get reports lung keep assumption finally however tend gives size cancer sample alarming thinks woken stop cause intuitively folk change evidence behind action completely problem

,"I wish memory could be shared. If you saw what this looks like under water and how far advanced it is, you'd be running around like I am. Humanity doesn't help. We burn resources for ourselves, and unless you guys stop deciding anything with a group focus is evil and communist, it's going to stay that way. 

Doing nothing, at this point, is better than contributing to the problem. Until we have a meaningful direction, whether we're burning green resources or black ones, we're still burning things to stop the fire from getting worse. We do see the absurdity in the race to find a technological fix to the problem created by our fixation with technology, yes?

The ""rush"" we're putting on all this doesn't help because that translates into resource usage. To get resource usage down, we need to take only what we need. But we're not going to because people like yourself insist on perpetuating this idea that we're going to get our shit together at some point and unsink the ship. It's not helping and hasn't helped over the last 20 years that we've wasted. 

How much harder is it to come up with climate fixes with COVID happening? How much easier do you think it's going to get, where we can resume some sort of focus on edging in a green direction? This war requires the willingness to stop taking, and to find value in existence outside the material. 

Or we keep pretending we're on our way to fixing this and make it worse faster. 

What technology are you so optimistic about that it's going to allow for us to continue living like this in perpetuity? Is it doomerism or have we created a doomsday machine that we need to walk away from? How does this paradigm not end in the extinction of all life? And if you're going to say ""technology"" can you share exactly which technology is so promising, how we're going to power it, and how we're going to build it while up to our tits in virus, parasites, water, and god knows what? 

I'm not saying we give up on life, I'm saying we face the reality of the world we've created and work from there. What we're doing now is focusing on the tech and money and projecting that onto the world; we're trying to solve a problem we have right now with imaginary tools that don't exist. It's time to be real about this and what to expect or we're all just lying to ourselves and might as well keep burning oil.

,"would you agree that wood is the work done by a plant using the sun, but really it's just the sun's energy converted into chemical work. That chemical work accumulates in the form of cellulose etc. When you burn through a log of wood, you're literally burning through the time that tree was alive for, and the sunlight that landed on that tree drove that accumulation at a relatively constant rate. The energy stored in plants is the energy of the sun. Oil is the product of 100M years of compression on various stages of ~peat decomposition, which is also energy of the sun. I think it's something like 70 acres of pasture worth of accumulation in one barrel of oil, so 70/acre years of sunlight are in one barrel of oil... something like that. But it's truly the product of 100's of thousands of years of ideal growing conditions more than 100M years ago, all being released into our air. It's a solar debt that we've created and reinforce every year so every year the concentration goes up rather than stabilizing.

All major forms of energy are driven by the sun... or a sun, in the case of nuclear

,"No problem friend. I also go into anxiety spirals over this even now. But I have to tell myself this, and also another key point that is overlooked.

Almost all of these predictions are based on A) we do nothing. Or B) we stay with the targets we set now.

Both of these are very negative scenarios. We definitely aren’t doing nothing, and all signees of the Paris Agreement know that the initial targets are whack. But that’s why they are initial targets. Each nation will use 2050 as a baseline and work out how easy/hard it will be to hit or beat that. 2023 was set as the ‘stocktake year’ where nations will use these projections and see where aid, stronger targets, CO2 exchanges (i.e. if Japan can’t hit because there’s no space-they provide funding to Canada who can hit theirs AND overshoot by planting etc) etc.

The Paris Agreement has been shit on a lot here because there’s no legal repercussions for not hitting targets. But the agreement has some really strong partnership working stuff in it that IS working.

So if we want to manage flood risk in village x, we work with other organisations to include biodiversity net gain, large scale tree planting etc. Sounds really obvious but it’s surprising how little joined up thinking there’s been previously. 

Early days atm, but there’s a real growing enthusiasm for it here. Hopefully I’ll be able to make a tiny difference in the long run.

,"**[Climate change feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate change feedback)**

Climate change feedback is important in the understanding of global warming because feedback processes may amplify or diminish the effect of each climate forcing, and so play an important part in determining the climate sensitivity and future climate state. Feedback in general is the process in which changing one quantity changes a second quantity, and the change in the second quantity in turn changes the first. Positive (or reinforcing) feedback amplifies the change in the first quantity while negative (or balancing) feedback reduces it.The term ""forcing"" means a change which may ""push"" the climate system in the direction of warming or cooling. An example of a climate forcing is increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

Not everyone agrees with your tipping point opinion. [Here](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/33/19656) is a report that discusses that issue. The part that worries me the most is:

“—recall that RCP8.5 2005 to 2020 total cumulative CO2 emissions are within 1% of historical emissions—the issue of missing carbon cycle climate feedbacks is critical. In effect, these will act to raise both IEA scenarios toward the cumulative emissions represented by RCP8.5 and away from RCP4.5. These missing biotic feedbacks include permafrost thaw, changes in soil carbon dynamics, changes to forest fire frequency and severity, and spread of pests ([**10**](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/33/19656#ref-10)). While it is unclear the extent to which these missing pathways would close the emissions gap—our level of understanding here is low”

,"What predictions are you even talking about? What's funny is you talk about how predictions aren't accurate yet you hold them to such high scrutiny. In the world of science, some predictions will be off, that's just how it goes. You have to look at both the consensus and the predictions that take into account numerous variables. Sometimes they can miss out on key things.

Taking a look at some of the predictions from the past it seems to be exactly as I've described. Some being overzealous, and some too conservative. There is also some bang on. However, the general consensus has shown to be a steady rise in global emissions and global temperatures. This is exactly what happened. 

[This analysis](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming) shows predictions made in the past about the global rise in temperature. What it largely shows is that the majority of predictions were very accurate give or take for some studies that varied from too much to too little to what has actually been observed.

In that article, you can see that among the most accurate predictions came from the IPCC. Their predictions for global temperatures have been spot on.

There are fringe predictions from obscure and unqualified professors that people love boasting about, but actually looking at the scientific consensus tells a different story. 

Looking at polar ice cap predictions [Its shown](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/arctic-sea-ice-global-warming-climate-change-predictions/) that arctic and antarctic sea ice is melting at a pace faster than almost all predictions.

1.  because the rate of warming is a fuckthousand faster than the one related to milankovich cycles which you can see in that graph take hundreds of thousands of years. you have seen geological changes that should take more than a thousand years happen in your lifetime. you are feeling it. yet you believe propaganda instead that this is a tens of thousands years cycle. in less than 100 years temps have gone up 1.5 degrees. that takes more than a thousand years in times of planetary crisis!!! let alone normally!!. and they are going to climb to + 10. thats uninhabitable for us (+3 degrees already is) and should take waaaaaaaay more than ten thousand years. you would live to see it but youll die before.

2. you saw how i posted how well models predict warming comparing them to all data sources? you know why they work so well? because they rely on the warming caused by co2 to explain the warming. all other factors cant explain it. suggesting its something else its like having a teapot boiling on the outside on a stove but suggesting it might be the sun or the warm air and not the fire the main cause of the water boiling when you know very well how much heat each factor causes.


3. many factors infuence the climate and while the effect of the melankovich cycles would be greatly influential. they are i flu3nced by other stuff... like obviously co2. which is much more important evidently to decide their result.


co2 (obviously) is the main controller of the planets temperature. its high school physics man. you can test in your kitchen how co2 traps heat, calculate how much and then use that data to calculate the planets temps.

Cycles are cumulative. The motion of the sun and solar systems are all cyclical. At times the amplitudes of cycles are additive when they are in phase and cancel when out of phase. Different amplitudes, different phases, all natural influencing each other to varying degrees.  Some daily, some over many millennia, and some over greater periods like the 250 million year cycle of the solar system around the centre of the galaxy.

We should abolish lawns,"The fact that we still have lawns full of short grass that we methodically mow once a week is a significant contributor to climate change. 

Firstly, by replacing whatever natural vegetation would grow in the area with short grass, we reduce the land's ability to take in CO2. By preventing the grass from growing tall, we significantly reduce the amount of CO2 we keep out of the atmosphere, and prevent native ecosystems from developing. Even if grass grows at the same rate whether it's constantly mowed or not, we could replace lawns with forests to fight climate change.

But secondly, and more importantly, lawn mowing consumes a huge amount of resources. In addition to the CO2 produced by the fossil fuels in lawn mowers (or the equivalent energy cost of electric lawnmowers), fertilizers produce nitrous oxide, a very powerful greenhouse gas.

According to https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa8nan/your-well-manicured-lawn-is-contributing-to-climate-change, a maintained lawn contributes about as much to climate change as a transatlantic flight. If 100 million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns, that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions, and that's not counting planting trees to replace the lawns with forests. It's an area no one seems to be talking about, but it seems like we could get a decent impact just by telling people to stop doing something.",The fact that we still have lawns full of short grass that we methodically mow once a week is a significant contributor to climate change Firstly by replacing whatever natural vegetation would grow in the area with short grass we reduce the lands ability to take in CO By preventing the grass from growing tall we significantly reduce the amount of CO we keep out of the atmosphere and prevent native ecosystems from developing Even if grass grows at the same rate whether its constantly mowed or not we could replace lawns with forests to fight climate change But secondly and more importantly lawn mowing consumes a huge amount of resources In addition to the CO produced by the fossil fuels in lawn mowers or the equivalent energy cost of electric lawnmowers fertilizers produce nitrous oxide a very powerful greenhouse gas According to a maintained lawn contributes about as much to climate change as a transatlantic flight If million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions and thats not counting planting trees to replace the lawns with forests Its an area no one seems to be talking about but it seems like we could get a decent impact just by telling people to stop doing something,219,like constantly methodically trees atmosphere still week million equivalent co preventing grow rate natural put much consumes full thats cost homes climate maintained greenhouse total amount whether replace take people pretty even ecosystems developing reduce grass growing one something gas us could area planting would produced tall ability native produce grows energy counting impact prevent flight stopped fact seems according lands lawnmowers emissions contributor telling powerful importantly whatever mowed lawns fuels nitrous lawn fossil electric stop transatlantic change significantly dent short large talking mowers secondly maintaining mow forests decent significant oxide fight mowing vegetation resources get addition keep huge fertilizers firstly contributes replacing

,"Done this, can recommend. Although the forest part is difficult, trees are slow-growers. It attracts many birds, bees, butterflies and other insects (spiders, worms, slugs, moths), plus their predators (cats, foxes). It smells divine and I sometimes eat some of the berries. It's an oasis for the animals in an urban desert. I think it looks amazing but I know some people think it's ""untidy"". I am like yes and that's the way it's meant to be. My neighbors have complained once about a ""large amount of vegetation"". It was trimmed. It takes up a large amount of water, stores a large amount of carbon, nourishes the soil, prevents erosion and hosts a compost heap. The compost heap recycles all the green waste, onsite with no transport or disposal costs. The recycled nutrients never leave the property and instead make the garden even bigger. Dry woody waste, which can be up to 50% pure carbon, is stored in a flat pile which I occasionally walk/jump on and rake out the smashed pieces over the ground, where I leave them to rot amongst leaf litter. It makes the ground a bit higher, I'm considering making some terracing. I'm a bit worried about a fire. As a fire-break I do keep a clear perimeter - with lawn on it - near the house.

See also: rewilding, urban meadows movement, permaculture (slightly guessing these, still researching)

Edit: more (I love this topic) - it creates ecosystems, of many kinds. It breeds all kinds of animals and they go and make healthier ecosystems on the surrounding properties. I am worried it might be a home for rats, but I'm hoping the cats will fix that. It's a fabulous opportunity to get hands-on with the workings of ecosystems, evolution and nature. The metaphors and lessons that are contained within are broadly applicable to all ecosystems, all life. All I do is remove the stuff I don't want. I occasionally dump collected rainwater on the compost heap. That's an ecosystem all to itself. One of the birds has figured out that when I rearrange the compost heap, it's feeding time. He loves the spiders and also small bugs. He will hover for spiders. He's got so bold he will get in the way of me watering it. He sings quietly to himself as he patiently awaits the next insect to break cover.

This allows insects to populate those places and when cut down, some patches are left untouched so they can still migrate somewhere near and safe. I gotta say, seeing all the flowers and sometimes kids or dogs play in there is nice :-) In suburban areas with a lot of one-family homes, short grass is the norm though...

In their own zoning district, yes. That's where the political system gives them an express opportunity to have their voice heard. But the authority of people in one zoning district doesn't typically extend to legal matters in another zoning district, for good reasons. 

>And in a democracy, state and federal law can override local laws.

They can — but in the US, most states have expressly delegated zoning power to local authorities. Specifically because local authorities are in the best position to make zoning decisions. Because of this principle that it's the locals who live in a district whose authority should be primary for neighborhood-character issues like zoning. 

You're just trying to find different ways to evade this obvious principle of local governance. Which makes you seem very uninformed on the topic.

You can see an even more dramatic spike for the last 11,000 years graph. We are at the warmest point without reasonable doubt.

And it’s not all that surprising given the known physics of gases like Carbon Dioxide.

,"Climate change is a prime suspect in a mass die-off of Alaska's snow crabs, experts say, after the state took the unprecedented step of canceling their harvest this season to save the species.

According to an annual survey of the Bering Sea floor carried out by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, estimates for the crustaceans' total numbers fell to about 1.9 billion in 2022, down from 11.7 billion in 2018, or a reduction of about 84 percent.

For the first time ever, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced the Bering Sea snow crab season will remain closed for 2022-23, saying in a statement efforts must turn to ""conservation and rebuilding given the condition of the stock."" The state's fisheries produce 60% of the nation's seafood.


The species is also found in the more northward Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, but they do not grow to fishable sizes there.

Erin Fedewa, a marine biologist with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, told AFP the shocking numbers seen today are the result of heatwaves in 2018 and 2019.

The ""cold water habitat that they need was virtually absent, which suggests that temperature is really the key culprit in this population decline,"" she said.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Alaska is the fastest warming state in the country, and is losing billions of tons of ice each year — critical for crabs that need cold water to survive. 

""Environmental conditions are changing rapidly,"" Ben Daly, a researcher with ADF&G, told CBS News. ""We've seen warm conditions in the Bering Sea the last couple of years, and we're seeing a response in a cold adapted species, so it's pretty obvious this is connected. It is a canary in a coal mine for other species that need cold water.""

Historically an abundant resource in the Bering Sea, their loss is considered a bellwether of ecological disruption.

There are thought to be several ways that warmer temperatures have depleted the species.

Studies have pointed toward a higher prevalence of Bitter Crab Disease as the temperature heats up.

The crustaceans, named for their love of cold water, are also under greater metabolic stress in warmer waters, meaning they need more energy to stay alive.

""A working hypothesis right now is that the crabs starved, they couldn't keep up with metabolic demands,"" said Fedewa.

Young snow crabs in particular need low temperatures to hide out from their major predator, Pacific cod, and temperatures in regions where juveniles typically reside jumped from 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2017 to 3.5 Celsius in 2018 (35 degrees Fahrenheit to 38 degrees Fahrenheit) — with studies indicating 3C might be an important threshold.

More research is underway and findings should be published soon, but in the meantime, ""everything really points to climate change,"" Fedewa said.

""These are truly unprecedented and troubling times for Alaska's iconic crab fisheries and for the hard-working fishermen and communities that depend on them,"" Jamie Goen, executive director of Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers said in a statement, lamenting that second and third generation crab-fishing families ""will go out of business.""

The industry was also hit by the cancellation of Bristol Bay red king crab fishing for the second year in a row.

Fedewa also noted that overfishing isn't a big factor in the population collapse of snow crabs.

Fishing removes only large adult males, she said, ""and we've seen these declines across all sizes of snow crab, which really suggest some bottom-up environmental driver is at play.""

Male Alaska snow crabs can reach six inches (15 centimeters) in shell width, but females seldom grow larger than three inches, according to NOAA.

In some good news, this year's survey saw significant increases in the immature crabs compared to last year — but it will take four or five years before the males among them grow to fishable size.

Following the heatwave years, temperatures have returned to normal, and ""the hope is that leaving crabs untouched will allow them to reproduce, there'll be no mortalities, and we can just let the stock try to recover,"" said Fedewa.

Gabriel Prout, whose Kodiak Island fishing business relies heavily on the snow crab population, told CBS News that there needs to be a relief program for fisherman, similar to programs for farmers who experience crop failure, or communities affected by hurricanes or flooding.

When asked what fishermen can do in this situation, with their livelihoods dependent on the ocean, Prout responded, ""Hope and pray. I guess that's the best way to say it.""",Climate change is a prime suspect in a mass dieoff of Alaskas snow crabs experts say after the state took the unprecedented step of canceling their harvest

That graph is of reported disasters. Note that the line is flat until the International Geophysical Year of 1957 when a concerted effort was made to place tracking stations globally. Then the slope rises gradually as surface stations are placed. Then comes 1978 with the first tracking satellites and the number rises rapidly. Now that sufficient numbers of tracking devices are in place such that no storm is missed the slope is once again flat.

and deaths per decade - https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/04/Global-annual-death-rate-from-natural-disasters-01.png

These snippets from the AR5 Executive Summary:

 - Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate variability (including phenomena such as El Niño), and natural decadal or multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop for anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide variety of natural weather and climate extremes would still occur. [3.1

 - A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes, and can result in unprecedented extremes. Changes in extremes can also be directly related to changes in mean climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected to lie within the tails of present-day conditions. Nevertheless, changes in extremes of a climate or weather variable are not always related in a simple way to changes in the mean of the same variable, and in some cases can be of opposite sign to a change in the mean of the variable. Changes in phenomena such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation or monsoons could affect the frequency and intensity of extremes in several regions simultaneously.

So even the IPCC says that there is no uptick in disasters and that those that do occur can be attributed to natural processes.

>By affordable and reliable energy sources I mean dense, cheap and uninterrupted, so no, not ""renewables"".

Renewables (wind/solar) already produce a major part of electricity consumption in some countries, so arguably it is affordable. Example countries : Germany, Denmark (check ourworldindata). It's also clear that costs have come down.

To my knowledge, adoption hasn't so far caused unreliability in Denmark or Germany. I've read more about Texas having issues with their power grid. And what makes Texas special? It's a very isolated grid, contrary to Denmark and Germany.

,">And what makes Texas special? It's a very isolated grid, contrary to Denmark and Germany.

I have lived in Texas all my life so know the climate and politics well. It has an isolated electric grid and although that was part of the problem, it was not the main problem. Texas has a substantial wind energy production the makes a sizable contribution to electrical production. But it is seasonal and is small during the winter months. For that reason it was not producing much electricity when the outages began during the ice storm and it was not being used as a primary energy source by ERCOT ( the Texas management system). The problem was the gas lines froze up and coal piles were too wet right when maximum electricity and maximum residential heating was needed. This caused a cascading effect when power stations started dropping offline as generation was unable to keep up with the requirements. The same thing happened in 2011. A federal report investigated the problem at that time and found the grid needed to be winterized. But the Texas government recommended the changes instead of requiring the changes and since Texas has a competitive system no one spent the extra money to make the changes.  
  
Texas has an independent electric grid because they do not what to be regulated by the federal government. Since the grid does not cross state lines they can avoid regulation. At this time Texas has still only changed slightly the requirements to winterize and if another storm happens like before will probably have the same problem.  
  
I live in the small part of Texas that is just outside the regulation of ERCOT. As a result my electric provider is regulated by the federal government which requires their grid to be winterized. We never lost power during that whole time.

,"New ice age



The US is currently drilling a new ice core (see here), already at 1,512 meters where it is 7,700 years old, that is dated absolutely by counting annual ice layers, and each layer will be analyzed for temperature, greenhouse gases, and other constituents. This will give us the best Antarctic record yet. I believe the results will confirm the above. We geologists owe it to policy-makers to give them the benefit of our longer-term perspective. I believe we will regret regulating CO2, since doing so will not produce any measurable climate control, and may actually cause great harm to world economies. If we want to promote renewable energy sources (and I do), let us not penalize fossil fuel production and use.  We may soon need all the energy we can produce, if the long-term cooling continues.
My main point is that natural variation is so large, even if we cease all emissions completely, the climate will still change (just look at the graphs). The cost of (possibly) slightly influencing this change is so great, why not spend a lot less adapting to it? Since we don’t know if the long-term climate is cooling or warming (I bet on cooling long-term), we could spend trillions to cut emissions, only to have the climate cool catastrophically on its own. What then? Pump as much CO2 into the air as possible?
Warming is not a killer, but global cooling is. It would only take a few years of global crop failures from cold weather to put populations at serious risk. Both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are thickening: Leave anything on the ice, and it gets buried pretty fast (for example: the US South Pole Base was recently reconstructed because the old base was being crushed by snow and ice, and WWII planes lost on Greenland’s southeast coast, were covered by 264 feet of ice in 50 years: see the image below). This is not rocket science. Sure, the sea-level edges are retreating (that is why we call them the ablation zones of a glacier), but they represent a minute portion of the continent-scale ice mass.",New ice age The US is currently drilling a new ice core see here already at meters where it is years old that is dated absolutely by counting annual ice layers and each layer will be analyzed for temperature greenhouse gases and other constituents This will give us the best Antarctic record yet I believe the results will confirm the above We geologists owe it to policymakers to give them the benefit of our longerterm perspective I believe we will regret regulating CO since doing so will not produce any measurable climate control and may actually cause great harm to world economies If we want to promote renewable energy sources and I do let us notpenalize fossil fuel production and useWe may soon need all the energy we can produce if the longterm cooling continues My main point is that natural variation is so large even if we cease all emissions completely the climate will still change just look at the graphs The cost of possibly slightly influencing this change is so great why not spend a lot lessadapting to it Since we dont know if the longterm climate is cooling or warming I bet on cooling longterm we could spend trillions to cut emissions only to have the climate cool catastrophically on its own What then Pump as much CO into the air as possible Warming is not a killer but global cooling is It would only take a few years of global crop failures from cold weather to put populations at serious risk Both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are thickening Leave anything on the ice and it gets buried pretty fast for example the US South Pole Base was recently reconstructed because the old base was being crushed by snow and ice and WWII planes lost on Greenlands southeast coast were covered by feet of ice in years see the image below This is not rocket science Sure the sealevel edges are retreating that is why we call them the ablation zones of a glacier but they represent a minute portion of the continentscale ice mass,350,continentscale lot influencing promote image need drilling ice results crop see still south co portion constituents southeast ablation natural put much give best notpenalize cost gets confirm pole buried climate sheets currently greenlands dont gases graphs greenhouse perspective production cold take pretty even record control cease snow measurable know fast mass represent layer minute regulating yet leave call glacier world possibly populations risk us spend could dated continues want coast lessadapting sealevel sure meters cause would already new temperature main killer edges fuel produce variation catastrophically science geologists soon anything energy counting usewe reconstructed longterm cooling wwii may crushed old renewable cut age weather emissions great recently possible thickening example antarctic annual economies fossil retreating failures global analyzed policymakers change serious benefit regret sources planes completely large years owe longerterm harm actually bet zones cool believe since warming greenland slightly rocket feet let lost trillions core air look pump layers base absolutely point covered

,"Well we’re still planning but a few things and of course please google and if you or anyone has conflicting info please share. This is based on what I’ve researched online. I have reviewed a ton of “what states will be the best in climate change.” I am by no means an expert but this is what I’ve found.

Water is of course the most valuable resource. There are only a select few states that have first use water rights. Meaning if you own a house on land that has water on it, you have first right use to that, in effect you own the water. Of course this will be changed in the future but a lot of states you can’t even collect rain water. 

From what we’ve researched Michigan is the place to go. It’s super cheap right now (hellish winters though) but they have first use water rights and you can get a lot of land for cheap too, but most websites list Michigan on the top places to live for resources, location, Lower risk of forest fires, etc. we’ve also consider New York. 

That said we are also considering out of country for personal political and climate change reasons. 

I’m trying to research climate proof careers for maybe a career change. We’ve also decided to cut back on our spending, etc kind of treating now as a time to cut back so we can save. Food prices will go up, water will go up in price, etc so kind of prepping ahead of time and of course if we are wrong great we have extra money. 

We’re also considering vehicles with more options for repair (meaning more parts out there, etc). Not because we think it will go Mad Max but because I dont think people consider the economic impact as much as the climate impact.

,"Oh there have been billions of panics in history. But I live life based on probability. Unlike anytime in history including 1900s, we have booming population numbers, an industrial complex beyond the industrial revolution as far as chemicals to waste to gases, we have more cars, less forests, resources are needed increasingly more and more as both humans get born and technology grows and so far we are out pacing our ability to help regrowth. So it’s just logic. 

For instance, I was in a start up company of 100+ with a executives who sold companies before. January 2019 I was already telling them that this “Covid” that’s occurring in other countries will be a game changer and we need to prep. I said this because the rate and exposure at that point outside of the US was greater than we had seen in decades. By early March I was only one of 3 in the entire office trying to tell them. End of March they did a remote stay at home saying it would be two weeks. I laughed, it was easily going to be six months to a year at least. 

The reason because of probability and logic. I wasn’t afraid of it though I took it serious, I just looked at the whole picture. The world was already shutting down before the US which would have a economic and psychological trickle effect that would majorly change things even if Covid left quickly. Then when it hit the US, the sheer amount of people getting sick and staying home was unprecedented which means it will effect all channels of life. 

I also live off the rule that I can and will be and always have a chance at being wrong. Cross checking is super important. I use the above example as why I ask these things. 

Do I think the world will blow up anytime soon, no most likely not but will prices for water increase as demand grows and supply lowers, yes, it’s just simple economics. Will greed always be at the forefront of companies and billionaires selfishly taking advantage, always. So we continue a path where the supply lowers and demand is growing. 

So it boggles my mind because it’s just compounding evidence. The adage of “this always happens or cycles” is no longe true. My home state has had unprecedented forest fires and that’s not the only state. Countless lakes and water resources are reaching dangerously low levels (dangers meaning you may be fine today still but next year is the worry). Animals are in fact dying off at a large rate.

,"Existentialism is a beginning, an emergence from superstitions to which we were allegiant.  The other side of that stream seems empty and without purpose.  This makes us morose,  and though the path continues forward we don’t always see it.   We stand rooted to the deepening emotional pain and apathetic to our own well being of consciousness.  This is the feeling of separation from who we once were.  
  
This sounds like the horsey end of a Nietzsche book but it’s not.  The great philosophers were especially great because so much theory was generated from their creative minds.  The hard data simply was not there.    
  
Understanding how the brain works physically leads to the possibility of managing the why’s of emotional expression, and  illuminates the practice required for good physical and emotional health.  
  
What comes next is the realization that there is an organic structure to our happiness and health, and in this era, you can see it and act upon it.  
  
We are well into a great sweeping planetary transition, which is accelerating well beyond our means to react.  Our emotional mojo developed to serve a scene from thirty thousand years ago, and now here we are, with not a village nor settled family in sight.    
  
We evolved the emotional keys to fit into the organic structural locks of family, society, and environment, and now all of these lock shaped things are changing form and it seems our keys are beyond sticky.

,">More great news to fuel my existential dread.

Having ""existential dread"" means you, unlike most, understand that life has no inherent meaning. Now you need to create some meaning to your existence else you'll be condemned to a life of meaningless suffering.

Arthur Schopenhauer also believed life had no inherent meaning which caused us suffering but saw two paths to relieve that suffering: to live life as an ascetic and to pursue an interest in the creative arts.

He freely admitted that a life of asceticism wasn't practical for most. While this is true a life of minimalism is not only practical it lower our carbon footprint and be an example for others to follow. Minimalism is good for both the planet and ourselves in both physical and psychological ways.

The other path Schopenhauer spoke about was to find joy in the creative arts. When one is in the state of creativity one is in a state of ""flow"" or in Taoist terms ""wúwéi"" (effortless action). It is a place where no ""existential dread"" can enter.

The climate change crisis is frightening and is going to quickly change our world. To survive we as a people need to adapt. While many look to the ""heavens above"" for help those that have ""existential dread"" know that all our answers for salvation lie within us. Those answers are minimalism and finding joy within ourselves.

Practice minimalism and create something that will help all those people still asleep through the troubles ahead that we can and we must change.

Good luck.",More great news to fuel my existential dread Having existential dread means you unlike most understand that life has no inherent meaning Now you need to create some meaning to your existence else youll be condemned to a life of meaningless suffering Arthur Schopenhauer also believed life had no inherent meaning which caused us suffering but saw two paths to relieve that suffering to live life as an ascetic and to pursue an interest in the creative arts He freely admitted that a life of asceticism wasnt practical for most While this is true a life of minimalism is not only practical it lower our carbon footprint and be an example for others to follow Minimalism is good for both the planet and ourselves in both physical and psychological ways The other path Schopenhauer spoke about was to find joy in the creative arts When one is in the state of creativity one is in a state of flow or in Taoist terms wwi effortless action It is a place where no existential dread can enter The climate change crisis is frightening and is going to quickly change our world To survive we as a people need to adapt While many look to the heavens above for help those that have existential dread know that all our answers for salvation lie within us Those answers are minimalism and finding joy within ourselves Practice minimalism and create something that will help all those people still asleep through the troubles ahead that we can and we must change Good luck,258,footprint terms need existential else paths still follow condemned wwi climate existence inherent wasnt arthur crisis caused practical also people answers news know one world something freely us good admitted asceticism state minimalism physical interest help survive ascetic arts going action must meaning pursue fuel dread effortless heavens others find quickly unlike place path within create live creative asleep finding great many example believed salvation flow lie means schopenhauer change planet creativity lower psychological frightening adapt practice understand meaningless spoke true troubles taoist two relieve look life joy luck ahead youll suffering saw enter carbon ways

Sorry. It's my vice. =)

>I suppose adopting such a perspective could be reassuring to some in the midst of the climate crisis.

What if this crisis could lead us to a more equitable and happier world? 

Climate change is of course here and real. The best course of action is to greatly reduce our carbon foot print which would not only benefit mankind physically but done correctly could also benefit us psychologically. 

The single-family home and suburbs have to go for too many reasons to list. Replace them with low energy cohousing communities where residents share common faculties including EVs and also share an evening meal together. Hire a chef (preferably also a resident) and the rest of the kitchen staff are volunteers. Working late and can't make the meal? No problem, we'll leave you a take-away bag for you in your 'fridge for when you get home. Everyone gets a lower carbon footprint and a meal with friends. This is currently being done around the world with great success.

I am saddened by the climate change crisis. My last home and neighborhood will be uninhabitable due to rising sea levels in my son's lifetime. The same for the home and neighborhood I grew up in during his son's lifetime. But I can also see how this crisis could finally create the change needed to resolve the inequity and alienation Marx and so many others warned us about. I don't have a lot of hope but enough.

,"No, this is not correct. The person you replied to is also incorrect - it does not imply negative global GDP. The 5% hit to GDP is unrealized wealth. GDP will continue to grow but there will be costs associated with climate change potentially amounting to 5% of GDP.

For example, today's global GDP is 80T. Many economists believe this figure could double by 2050. In that scenario it is then 160T. But say these economists poorly estimated the costs of climate change which amounted to 5% of GDP growth over that time. The world GDP Is then 152T. This would be 8T in unrealized global wealth and it would be cumulative each year. The correct economic decision would be the policy that results in the lowest total when adding the cost of climate change + cost of mitigation. William Nordhaus won a Nobel Prize for his work on this topic and there are many summaries of his research out there if you want to learn more. Bjorn Lomborg also discusses this concept extensively.

,"So what you are getting at is - in my opinion - the core question of the entire climate change discussion.

I'm happy to provide some thoughts but I would definitely suggest you to check out the two people I mentioned in the prior comment if you want opinions on the topic that are smarter than mine.

> is this a big problem or is it insignificant?

It depends who you ask and it is all relative to the alternatives. There is a lot of disagreement about the economic implications of climate change. There is agreement that it will cost money but that is about where it ends. How much will it cost, how much of that cost can we prevent, and how much will that prevention cost are difficult questions to answer but they are all fundamental to answering your question. I think GDP is the correct/most useful measurement but arriving at high confidence predictions is easier said than done.

> Could GDP be great while billions are suffering due to climate change? Is this probable?

I would say improbable but only to the extent that we have seen immense wealth creation during the past century and suffering still exists. By many important measures (extreme poverty, malnutrition, child mortality, illiteracy, etc) we have seen huge reductions in suffering and I don't think it is unreasonable to expect those trends to continue.

> My main concern is people keep using this 5% meme to say climate change is peanuts and not worth dealing with, are they right?

They may be right but if they don't explain it *relative to the cost of mitigation* they don't understand the why behind the ""5% meme"". That said, I think they are likely *closer* to being right than wrong. That isn't to say I don't think we should be taking action to reduce our emissions. I believe we should.

,"Yeah you completely misunderstood what that meant, either that or good job on that strawman. It means that each decade is getting systematically hotter than the previous decade.

,"The truth is the truth, it doesnt change just because you don't want to believe it. The truth is unapologetic, it is simply the truth. By not using your intelligence to actually research beyond everything you're told, you're nothing more than a sheep (i know you are actually more than a sheep, so maybe prove me right). One of the signatories to the 11000 scientists report was from Disney, as per page 203 of the signatory report. https://wfpquantum.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/2019/36931_Climate-emergency-signatory-list.pdf ... Professor Micky Mouse signed, from the Micky Mouse Institute for the Blind (along with all who BLINDly believe in unintentional manmade CC). So you have that name on the list (page 203), together with 70 psychologists, 29 political scientists, 59 renew(energy)ologists, 73 economists and many students of all descriptions (probably the same ones who do the IPCC reports). Also, a unesco report shows more than 8million scientists worldwide. https://en.unesco.org/unesco_science_report/figures ... so we have .001375% of scientists claiming this as a fact. Also, on www.petitionproject.org there are signatories of over 30,000 scientists saying the opposite of these supposed ""climate scientists"". Moreover, as described on www.realclimatescience.com - in an article titled ""listen to the scientists"" it says the following - ""It is important to listen to the scientists.  They are advocating genocide on a scale never before seen on earth, and say that anyone other than themselves lack the qualifications to participate in the discussion about whether or not this genocide should proceed. They say that citizens of the “Land of the Free” need to be excluded from a discussion about their proposal for genocide. This combination of genocidal scientists, their big lie, and demands for censorship occurred several times during the last century, particularly in China, Russia and Germany. These 11,000 scientists should lead by example and remove themselves from the planet.  That would go a tremendous way towards cleaning up the intellectual, political and journalistic environment of the earth. "" furthermore, 100% of Paul Ehrlich’s predictions from the 70's failed, where they were darn sure that global cooling was for sure...

Or does the sheep walk blindly to the slaughter? Take Australia's fires - firstly, it's not a natural drought. Cotton farming, along with frack wells (fracking) have depleted Way more water than australian citizens do (up to 15million litres per frack well, and there are over 40,000 of them in Oz). Channel 7 news Brisbane weather outlet reported in October of 2019 - trails of aluminium chaff on the weather map, but this was where the transparency ended - the news outlet went on blame it on a ""military exercise"" because clearly, many countries have been lining up to invade Australia cos we're so ""vulnerable"". Most importantly, chaff/chemtrails were released soon before the bushfires went off in nsw... Barium and strontium are in chaff, and these compounds are also accelerants used for SPARKLERS... watch thecrowhouse on youtube. This manmade climate change crap is utter nonsense and a complete hoax...the great artesian basin (which supplies most rivers and aquifers) is now close to depleted due to fracking (frack wells).. still sure about a ""climate emergency""?

Looking back through old photos and through the history it used to get real snow six months out of the year. 

The season was regularly Halloween through Easter. Great years were beginning of October through end of April sometimes even May. Every year they would be opening 2 weeks give or take later and ending 2 or 3 weeks earlier. My last year of work, my tenth year, the first real snowstorm didn't come until February and the season ended in mid March. Only 2 of those years they had decent snow storms come in, but only like 1 storm week and that was it. They had a reservoir system and blew their own snow. Towards the last year i rode there it was so dry the entire reservoir was empty, there wasn't even enough rain for them to blow their own snow even if they wanted to. It rarely even got below 40f.

,"This isn't an answer to your question, but the question reminds me of something that happened to me.

I grew up in West Michigan near the Lake Michigan shoreline. When I was a boy, my parents hosted our extended family Christmas parties. In 2019, my parents hosted the extended family Christmas party for the first time in a long time. At the party, we played the family videos, which were primarily videos from previous extended family Christmas party activities from when I was a boy in the 80s & 90s. There were hours of recording, so it was just something for people to watch in between conversations or whatever.

The shocking part is that every single one of those years shows the children playing in feet of snow and sledding down hills with snowmobile tracks. It was such a stark contrast because now there is little or no snow around the holidays every year and you never hear or see snowmobiles in December.

If you are 30+ and grow up where I did it would be hard to deny that there tends to be less snow on the ground than there was when we were younger, but the change over time is so gradual it can be almost imperceptible, but watching those videos taken from my parent's backyard 30ish years ago made that change so tangible.",This isnt an answer to your question but the question reminds me of something that happened to me I grew up in West Michigan near the Lake Michigan shoreline When I was a boy my parents hosted our extended family Christmas parties In my parents hosted the extended family Christmas party for the first time in a long time At the party we played the family videos which were primarily videos from previous extended family Christmas party activities from when I was a boy in the s s There were hours of recording so it was just something for people to watch in between conversations or whatever The shocking part is that every single one of those years shows the children playing in feet of snow and sledding down hills with snowmobile tracks It was such a stark contrast because now there is little or no snow around the holidays every year and you never hear or see snowmobiles in December If you are and grow up where I did it would be hard to deny that there tends to be less snow on the ground than there was when we were younger but the change over time is so gradual it can be almost imperceptible but watching those videos taken from my parents backyard ish years ago made that change so tangible,223,younger never ground shows year imperceptible see hills near grow played part reminds tangible single made isnt sledding hard hosted children michigan boy family long people hear snow parents tends christmas videos question time snowmobiles tracks december one snowmobile something primarily less lake conversations almost answer would contrast recording stark every taken extended hours watch around west ago whatever ish change years shocking little happened party previous first watching shoreline playing feet gradual backyard parties activities deny holidays grew

,"Causation is in general a hard question - if you have a variable that if you changed it, something other than what happend would have happened, then if that variable is in the right configuration, did it cause the event. Thinking about causation always involves an estimate of what would've happened if you changed a variable.

Does x cause y? We need to know what would happen if we change x. But, there is only one reality, so working out whether x causes y means we need someone who can estimate what would happen if x wasn't true.

,"If it helps to offer an anecdote, I live in South Louisiana, and have my whole life. I'm 39 years old, and was born in 1982. In my lifetime, it's snowed here I think 7, maybe 8, times. Most of those were before I turned 20. I think only _once_ has it snowed here since then. In my experience, it went from being once every 3-4 years to being once a decade. 

When I was about 6-7 years old, one winter we experienced such a hard freeze that a large pond (~2 acres) near our house was frozen _inches_ thick. So thick that full grown adults could safely walk out onto it. Since then the pond has frozen over a handful of times, but never thick enough to even attempt to walk on it. And maybe only once in the past decade at all.

I met an 80 old man (also from here) a few years ago during a local political campaign, and we got to chatting - climate change came up, and he told me that when he was growing up here in the 1940s, snow may not have been considered a super-common event, but it would snow for a day or two every year, sometimes skipping a year. But what he really marveled at - what made him believe that climate change was a 'Thing' - was the near-total lack of icicles on front porches and the eaves of roofs in the last few decades. He said that in the 1940s and 50s, multiple times a year, _every year,_ there'd be a hard freeze during a storm (usually sleet) that'd cover the eaves and porches of every house with icicles anywhere from an inch to a foot long.

Reverting back now to MY experience, the only time in the past decade that I can remember for sure there were icicles like that (let's face it, icicles aren't as fun and memorable as snow) was this past February, when we got hit by the tail-end of that massive freeze that hit Texas, and shut down their entire power grid. I can't recall any icicles from 2000-2010, either (not ruling them out though).

None of this is overly surprising, considering that one of the major effects of climate change is a disruption in major jetstreams - like last year's freeze was caused by a gigantic pocket of arctic air getting dislodged.",If it helps to offer an anecdote I live in South Louisiana and have my whole life Im years old and was born in In my lifetime its snowed here I think maybe times Most of those were before I turned I think only _once_ has it snowed here since then In my experience it went from being once every years to being once a decade When I was about years old one winter we experienced such a hard freeze that a large pond acres near our house was frozen _inches_ thick So thick that full grown adults could safely walk out onto it Since then the pond has frozen over a handful of times but never thick enough to even attempt to walk on it And maybe only once in the past decade at all I met an old man also from here a few years ago during a local political campaign and we got to chatting climate change came up and he told me that when he was growing up here in the s snow may not have been considered a supercommon event but it would snow for a day or two every year sometimes skipping a year But what he really marveled at what made him believe that climate change was a Thing was the neartotal lack of icicles on front porches and the eaves of roofs in the last few decades He said that in the s and s multiple times a year _every year_ thered be a hard freeze during a storm usually sleet thatd cover the eaves and porches of every house with icicles anywhere from an inch to a foot long Reverting back now to MY experience the only time in the past decade that I can remember for sure there were icicles like that lets face it icicles arent as fun and memorable as snow was this past February when we got hit by the tailend of that massive freeze that hit Texas and shut down their entire power grid I cant recall any icicles from either not ruling them out though None of this is overly surprising considering that one of the major effects of climate change is a disruption in major jetstreams like last years freeze was caused by a gigantic pocket of arctic air getting dislodged,387,went dislodged like fun never tailend handful year south february near considering day full gigantic attempt told pocket face porches made sometimes entire lets climate hard eaves frozen offer caused inch decade usually turned also long snowed even jetstreams helps snow anywhere born thing ruling remember surprising front freeze time effects growing grid chatting one thatd could disruption experience neartotal met think cant reverting sure would walk thick every multiple cover overly times roofs memorable hit past safely may foot house old getting live power none adults campaign lifetime supercommon experienced ago man icicles considered really either though winter shut pond change lack large years decades said political thered came since believe maybe onto enough got inches sleet event arctic acres im arent louisiana texas anecdote back two recall air life skipping marveled local grown major whole last massive storm

,"Or, maybe looking at it from a different direction: *every* individual weather event is the sum of multiple causes. Attributing a warm spell to one cause is not the right way of thinking of it. Maybe 60% of it is caused by normal local weather variability, 15% is some unusual upper atmosphere event that is not climate related, 10% is El Nino, and 15% is climate change (just throwing out random percentages as an example of what I mean)

Or you can put it like: if climate change was not here, you still would have had a warm winter, but it wouldn't be quite *this* hot. Those 80°F days would have been 76°F without climate change.

An analogy: weather is like the waves coming up on the beach, while climate is like the tide. Your hot weather spell is like big waves hitting the shoreline. But the highest water levels happen when big waves come in on top of a high tide. Similarly, the hottest winters happens when a hot weather system comes in on top of higher temperatures caused by climate change.",Or maybe looking at it from a different direction every individual weather event is the sum of multiple causes Attributing a warm spell to one cause is not the right way of thinking of it Maybe of it is caused by normal local weather variability is some unusual upper atmosphere event that is not climate related is El Nino and is climate change just throwing out random percentages as an example of what I mean Or you can put it like if climate change was not here you still would have had a warm winter but it wouldnt be quite this hot Those F days would have been F without climate change An analogy weather is like the waves coming up on the beach while climate is like the tide Your hot weather spell is like big waves hitting the shoreline But the highest water levels happen when big waves come in on top of a high tide Similarly the hottest winters happens when a hot weather system comes in on top of higher temperatures caused by climate change,179,related different thinking nino hitting levels highest higher every multiple like big temperatures f quite attributing beach happen el high throwing maybe coming waves direction atmosphere still comes random normal event top variability come right one days weather shoreline put way spell unusual looking system example wouldnt causes hot climate upper winter warm tide happens local individual similarly water cause hottest would winters change caused sum mean without analogy percentages

,"There was an erratic collapse of the polar vortex just a few years ago in Jan 2019. The polar vortex cycles air high up in the atmosphere.

,"Maybe.

As the arctic melts there will be a pool of warmer wetter air later into the fall.   The cold spot moves over central Siberia.  

The engine of the jet stream is the temperature differential bewteen the equator and the poles.  As the poles warm up, the jet stream wanders more.  The result is that large masses of very cold air can wander around, following the jet stream much like a St. Bernard chasing a pork chop.

I don't see it.  At least not in the US.  Let's not forget that the conservative approach to cutting emissions was supposed to be exactly what George Bush Sr did on acid rain: pricing pollution.  Either through cap-and-trade or carbon taxes.  Unfortunately, thanks to folks like Grover Norquist, most of the American conservative movement has basically come to believe that any economic penalty on pollution is a tax.  And they are pathologically allergic to taxes.

The idea of simply pricing pollution is so dead, that even Democrats won't consider it.  This means there's only one possible path forward: spending.  But we've just seen that most conservatives are allergic to that too.  And this with conservatives in both parties.  This is also why the Republican climate caucus has zero suggestions beyond spending a little bit on adaptation.

,"I’ll simply say this: AR6 draws some considerable focus to the worst-case scenario which, by almost all measurable metrics, is nearly an impossibility. We’re headed for a different world, and one that renders certain areas likely inhospitable. But we’re not headed for cataclysm, even in your lifetime, despite what the news outlets are selling.

Also, the completely ridiculous headlines lately about things ‘warming up faster than expected’ is literal complete fucking hogwash and we are actually warming up at the *exact projected speed* we always were. The IPCC also admits to believing we are in a medium-high pathway currently, which likely renders us between +2.6-3.2c by 2100. This isn’t good, but it’s far from a death sentence. Read the science, not the headlines.

Also, there is some thoughtful reflection of IPCC scenarios that is worth exploring in-depth here. Note that Pielke has a bit of controversy behind him (mostly because of his opinions on some policy implementation issues) but Justin Ritchie is clean. Lots to think about here.

Truthfully I think the next thing is the best thing for any layperson to read about AR6. It covers almost everything you need to know simply, relatively succinctly and without having to drive yourself bonkers over the hard science.

Hang in there, act locally and vote globally. It’s okay to relinquish control over some of this stuff, it’s a little beyond our individual grasps. Focus on surrounding yourself with positive people and situations, and embracing what you have while it’s here. That’s all we can ever do in life, climate change or not.",Ill simply say this AR draws some considerable focus to the worstcase scenario which by almost all measurable metrics is nearly an impossibility Were headed for a different world and one that renders certain areas likely inhospitable But were not headed for cataclysm even in your lifetime despite what the news outlets are selling Also the completely ridiculous headlines lately about things warming up faster than expected is literal complete fucking hogwash and we are actually warming up at the exact projected speed we always were The IPCC also admits to believing we are in a mediumhigh pathway currently which likely renders us between c by This isnt good but its far from a death sentence Read the science not the headlines Also there is some thoughtful reflection of IPCC scenarios that is worth exploring indepth here Note that Pielke has a bit of controversy behind him mostly because of his opinions on some policy implementation issues but Justin Ritchie is clean Lots to think about here Truthfully I think the next thing is the best thing for any layperson to read about AR It covers almost everything you need to know simply relatively succinctly and without having to drive yourself bonkers over the hard science Hang in there act locally and vote globally Its okay to relinquish control over some of this stuff its a little beyond our individual grasps Focus on surrounding yourself with positive people and situations and embracing what you have while its here Thats all we can ever do in life climate change or not,260,lots scenario opinions situations clean embracing ever reflection need vote drive speed relinquish sentence everything certain considerable bit thats best isnt climate currently hard okay exact projected cataclysm different also people believing hang even news control next measurable say thing know read admits positive one nearly death world exploring ill worth us simply good grasps mediumhigh think things implementation headed truthfully fucking almost indepth mostly behind locally stuff hogwash despite renders science lately thoughtful faster metrics ridiculous layperson lifetime scenarios likely ar c succinctly far justin worstcase ipcc impossibility complete individual change literal inhospitable without completely ritchie bonkers little actually pielke always covers beyond controversy issues warming selling act outlets focus globally surrounding relatively life draws note areas policy expected pathway headlines
,"First of all props to you OP for having the courage to ask here and also for educating yourself. You’re generation and those that follow you will definitely be growing up in a world much less stable than you deserve. I think one thing that you, and anyone you can convince to join you, should do is organize. Contact your local,  state, and congressional representatives. They need to know that this is problem #1-5 on your personal watch list and that you and your brethren all plan to vote accordingly. That you expect more and whatever action being undertaken now is not good enough. Shaming people doesn’t always work but in this scenario I’ll be damned if these offices will take being shamed by thousands of young people all in agreement that it’s their futures on the line and how the failures of our representatives have literally put your lives and futures in serious jeopardy. This needs to happen in every town, city, and state because at every level there are things that can be done. 

We have to approach this from every angle. Locally we need to push for climate adaptation / resilience, and in doing our parts to help with mitigation where we can like increasing green spaces, (re)planting of forests and connecting habitats to reduce fragmentation. 

State level actions include all the above local pursuits plus a number of actions that require greater financial power. Increasing scholarship funding for the sciences aimed at tackling issues, like ecology, earth systems, engineering, materials sciences, marine sciences. Pushing for state policies to incentivize green business development. 

For federal representation like congressional and even government organizations we need to advocate for all the above from both state and local categories. As well as demanding some of the simplest things that we should have done decades ago, ie carbon tax. As an aside to just pushing for climate policies I think WE ALL must, absolutely must, all be in agreement that money is in fact not speech and we need to remove as much money out of politics that we can if we stand to make any positive changes to this and many other pressing issues of the day. 

I hope any of these ideas help. Even if all you do is get yourself and a couple of friends to go through the trouble of just calling some of those offices and letting them know that you are watching, learning, and will become a voter soon, this puts just that bit more pressure on them. If you can get something organized so that your school (and others in your area) to all put out a message (find ways to get press coverage too) you’ll have done a lot to put more pressure on the powers that be. Also doing any of those and documenting them would look great in a college application because it shows your commitment and resolve. College is still worth pursuing don’t let this sense of impending doom stop you from living your life and planning for the future.

(For example, I need to choose between an electric car or a bigger hybrid and you helpt me to choose the electric one). At some point I realized that I had to accept that I could not worry about all the things that where beyond my capacity. 
The second thing is to live in the moment. This helps a lot for happiness in general. It means actually focusing on what you are doing and experiencing right now and not be in your head thinking about all the things that are wrong in the world, because there are plenty and pondering about them won't do you any good.

,"It's important to not think about ACC the way that Hollywood portrays it, as a sudden calamitous event (or series of events) that turns Earth into a death world. Unless humans do something incredibly stupid like nuclear war, it is highly unlikely that you or your children will fade away in a wasteland. What ACC means for most people is that the societal buffers that we have to protect from human and natural disasters will erode with time. Like how there have always been devastating wildfires, but now greater numbers of people are being affected because a combination of ACC and people moving into fire-prone areas. It's the same ideas with hurricanes, famines, and other extreme natural events. Even without ACC, you would live in a world in which they would need to be prepared for such events. But with ACC, these events become significantly more likely.

This extends to human disasters as well. This includes war, of course, if humanity collectively loses its mind in response to mounting pressure from ACC. But it also includes non-lethal disasters such as failure of political democratic leadership and spread of authoritarianism, like we are witnessing now. When people are hurt and afraid, they tend to give their nations over to the biggest jerk in the room. When the consequences of ACC become serious enough that even the most corrupt politician can no longer deny it, there is a danger that people will vote for the person they think is most capable of solving it, even if he/she has to break a few eggs and/or constitutional amendments in the process.

My point in this is that what ACC actually means for most people (low-lying coastal areas aside) is not so much a new novel threat to humanity, but rather dealing with more serious versions of age-old problems with less breathing room for error. We will have to face our problems and the consequences rather than run, because we can't run from a global problem (either literally or figuratively). But ACC will not hit like an asteroid strike. You are very likely not condemned to a bleak hellscape - there will be times of joy and laughter just as there are today. There will still be beauty and wonder in the world, even if you have to travel further to see it. But when problems occur, whether natural or human in origin, they will hit harder and more often than they do now. Sometimes much more so. And you will have to be prepared for that.

,"It is important to remember that nature may be apathetic to humanity's plight, but it isn't cruel or judgmental. It isn't going to condemn all the generations of mankind to follow for our ""sins"". So there will likely never be a point where humanity has pushed nature so far that it simply decides to shake humanity off its back like fleas on a dog. The consequences of ACC accumulate as we continue to destabilize the climate, but that also means that there is probably no singular point of ""abandon all hope"" where there is no longer any use in trying to solve the problem. Passing the 2 degC limit set by the Paris agreement will sting, but not as much as passing 3 degC warming, and not nearly as much as passing 4 degC, etc. There is always a best that we can do.

Now, it is possible that if humanity *really* shoves the climate system, by say burning all our coal reserves, we might trigger one of the planet's ""tipping point"" landmines and render much of Earth inhospitable for unprotected humans - the aforementioned hellscape where you'd have to wear a spacesuit to visit Florida. But I don't think we are going to act *that* stupidly - triggering a planetary climate shift can't be done suddenly and ""accidentally"" the same way as a nuclear war. Humanity will likely find *some* way to avoid the worst possible consequences of ACC, even if it pays dearly in the process. The questions are how will we do it, how much needless suffering will we experience, and what price do we pay? Do we address ACC with the sociopolitical tools we currently have, come out of it with some damage, but with our liberal democratic institutions more-or-less intact? Or do we wait longer, suffer more damage, put authoritarian jerks in control, and experience a second ""Dark Age"" with our democratic institutions destroyed? I wish I knew the answer to that, but of course I don't.

So I know these aren't great words of hope, but maybe putting some perspective on the situation will help? ACC is a serious problem indeed, and I don't mean to downplay it, but try not to buy into the media hysteria machine either. ACC is a complex problem with complex consequences, and it isn't as simple as ""stop burning all fossil fuels next year or your kids will be digging up landfills for food"". You will likely have significantly more difficult and frequent problems to face as a result of ACC, but they will still have the opportunity to live meaningful and fulfilling lives just like us, despite the challenges we face.

,"I don’t think I mentioned tipping points? They’re certainly nothing to scoff at, and things we want to avoid if we can. But, in all fairness, the phrase *tipping point* is a relatively serious matter that has been fetishized by irresponsible reporting and people with a weak understanding of what they mean. These are multi-decade events at the minimum, mostly far beyond that scope. Centuries, millennia. Some can be curbed and reduced in a timely manner, others not so much. It’s somehow become a very trendy phrase due to its latent connotations, and less so because of its real-world fallout.

I’d really, really, REALLY suggest the third link in my OP as there are two very in-depth breakdowns of tipping points, what they mean, and their likelihood. They rate each potential tipping point based on trajectory and timescale for reversibility. The up-front-and-dirty is that we need to limit ALL of these to our best ability… for future generations’ sake. The collapse sub thinks that the BOE, for instance, is essentially their version of the rapture. In realistic terms… not so much. Not even close. 

Most tipping points are complex and I’ll let the experts speak for themselves, but for instance iirc the theorized additional heating if ALL methane were to be released by 2100 would come out to a staggering and world-altering… +0.17c of warming?

I don’t think you can compare the smart phone to removing 43 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year. And that’s assuming it doesn’t increase which is not realistic.

Yes there are technologies that are being worked on but they are no where close to being economically feasible on the scale needed. And even economically feasible means spending trillions of dollars each year. We can’t get governments to even spend money on reducing CO2 emissions much less spending money on removing it.

>instead of relying some guy on Reddit to spoon-feed you.

How does that help the debate? I also do some research that doesn’t agree with you.

>If none of my predictions come to fruition? Ok, then we’re at +2.6-3.2c and it keeps on rising, and every passing decade beyond 2100 becomes more and more unstable and uninhabitable.

Something like that is my fear. I certainly don't see it going down anytime in the future at this point.

I don’t agree your predictions are vanilla or even in line with all scientists. Of course they are in line with some but not all.

How does that help the debate? I just happen to disagree with you.

>I’m just a dude on Reddit. I don’t really know what you’re finishing for considering I do not pretend to be anywhere near an expert on the science nor that policy, just someone moderately informed.

I am the same as you. I certainly don’t claim to be an expert. But my concern is that all the talk about different pathways doesn’t match the CO2 PPM path which is still increasing exponentially and so far shows no sign of slowing down.

All of the scenarios are based on the amount of CO2 emitted by humans. All except the 8.5 assume reduced coal usage. None of them account for other forms of CO2 inserted into the atmosphere like wildfires which are becoming a problem or release of CO2 from permafrost. I think that you think permafrost is just a minor problem but some scientists think it could be major. And there are other tipping points that it’s possible we may or may not have already passed. So when I see the CO2 PPM value start to STOP increasing exponentially I will feel a lot better about global warming.

,"I’ve been thinking about how to explain my doubts about any eco-tech breakthroughs and it occurred to me that it’s not the breakthroughs that is the problem. We’ve already had many breakthroughs and there are now some large mechanical units that are removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However compared to how much we are adding to the atmosphere it’s minute. But the real problem is the energy that would be required to remove the CO2. When you think about how much energy was used to put that CO2 in the atmosphere by refineries and power plants, you can see it will take about the same amount to take it out. That is a huge amount of energy that must be paid for somehow. And how are we going to create the energy. Will it be by using fossil fuels or what?

,"I think I see what you’re saying. I guess we’ll have to have a bit of a gentleman’s disagreement on some of the meat. I just want to note that my approach was toward consoling anxieties about catastrophic media-esque chaos through his or her lifetime. If you’ll allow me to shed light on what I’m seeing here… (eliminating the snark because you’re right, how is it really helpful)?

The article posted is one I’m definitely familiar with… I thought it was actually a good, sober approach to the article in question. Here are some of my key take-aways for why I think it actually trends more positive and cautious than a tip toward more aggressive heating this century:

> They also acknowledge large uncertainty in this estimate, and say that it represents a “risk averse approach”.
*A key point is that, even if the self-perpetuating changes do begin within a few decades, the process would take a long time to fully kick in – centuries or millennia.*

> With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay presents the scenario as definite and imminent. The impression is given that 2°C is a definite “point of no return”, and that beyond that the “hothouse” scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the caveats that the 2°C threshold is extremely uncertain, and that even if it were correct, the extreme conditions would not occur for centuries or millennia.

So again, tipping points are not something I dismiss but there is still a ton of uncertainty, with most certainty coming in that they will likely be ‘activated’ this century but both does not support an abrupt change (in human terms) nor do some of these theories hold a ton of water when viewed in a technical sense of their interactions with the large-scale changes happening.

I’m truthfully just not sure where you’re seeing or reading anything about that level of warming… period. That was a line of thinking that generally got tossed out in 2013, let alone today. I can pull up a ton of things pretty easily showing that our current pathways are heading towards my prediction. I don’t know, I’m not looking for information to blindly support this notion, so much as finding it to be the prevalent theory in overall climate literature. 

Here’s a thread by Glen Peters himself (author of what you posted) substantiating some of my predictions. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/peters_glen/status/1222808991635513348

> In summary, I would say current emissions are tracking mid- to high-end scenarios. But, does that mean therefore we end up at 4-5°C? No. RCP85 emissions require huge coal use. It is possible to track RCP85 now, but deviate substantially in 2040.

^This is critically important to understanding my theory - RCP8.5 tracks similarly to nearly all realistic pathways for us (i.e. NOT the lowest ones), for the next few *decades,* this is something that I think gets lost on a lot of people - not necessarily saying you, but in case you didn’t know.

This article does a pretty good job corroborating this, and is written by the AR6 principle author.

https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/3c-world

> Our business-as-usual projection of 3C of warming — rather than 4 or 5C — is a testament to the progress in global decarbonization over the last few decades. It also reflects the fact that rapid growth in coal use during the 2000s was not necessarily characteristic of longer-term energy use trends. The world has taken concrete steps to move away from coal in the past decade, and this progress should be reflected in our assessment of likely emissions pathways — and their resulting climate impacts — going forward.

Just because we’re not seeing the scale of movement that we want, the overall scales are shifting and to a rather fair degree, and moderately quickly considering a complete decarbonization would quite literally sink most world economies and cause far more problems than climate change will in the next few decades. And to that,

> IEA scenarios still project future growth in fossil fuel use through 2040, just slower than most IPCC baseline scenarios, particularly for coal. For example, IEA’s CPS predicts that coal consumption will grow by around 0.5% per year through 2040, compared to growth rates between 1% and 3% for most AR5 and SSP baseline scenarios. Average annual growth in coal combustion across AR5 and SSP baseline scenarios is 1.5%. 

> Even a current policies scenario where emissions continued to steadily grow rather than leveling off after 2040 would still end up well-below the commonly used RCP8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario, which represents the highest end of the range of no-policy baseline scenarios examined in the literature. It would also have CO2 emissions around 20% lower than SSP3-7.0. Even if emissions do not peak after 2040, the lower emissions values in 2040 means that the total emissions over the century remain substantially lower.

> Warming in the the two IEA scenarios is calculated based on the difference between cumulative fossil fuel and industry emissions in each scenario and that in the SSP2-4.5 scenario. These cumulative emissions differences are converted into additional warming based on the IPCC SR15 TCRE value of 1.65C per 1000 PgC, with a range from 0.8C to 2.5C / 1000 PgC reflecting uncertainties in climate sensitivity. Finally, this additional warming is added to RCP4.5 warming projections, with the average, low, and high TCRE-based additional warming values added to the average, low, and high RCP4.5 warming values, respectively.

> In this analysis the two IEA scenarios imply end-of-century warming of a bit below 3C (2.9C for current policies, 2.7C for stated policies). They are a bit higher than the 2.6C mean outcome in RCP4.5, and lower than the 3C mean of RCP6.0. They produce nowhere near as much warming as the 4.5C mean estimate of RCP8.5, the scenario often described as a “business as usual” scenario. However, the uncertainties in climate sensitivity mean that current policies may result in as much as 3.8C warming — or as little as 2C warming.

I’ll fully admit my understanding of the technological side is a little lacking compared to the science, but I truthfully believe in my hear it’s a little naive and defeatist to think there won’t be substantial mitigation techniques we can find, alongside decarbonization, in the later half of the century. That’s an emotional idea, and one that I guess I just put faith into.

,"I’m just going to touch on a few points in your reply.

Glen Peters is not the author of what I posted but he is a respected climate scientists. If you look at the total CO2 emissions chart he posted it shows 2019 is closer to RCP8.5 than to any other RCP. The 2020 year CO2 emissions decreased, apparently due to COVID but 2021 has jumped and already passed 2019. And Glen states:

**I would say ""current emissions track the mid- to high-end of a range of long-term scenarios”.**

Your second link from Breakthrough looks to me like it was written by Zeke Hausfather and Justin Ritchie. I could not find where either was an AR6 principal author but maybe I just missed it. The first link in that article to the IEA did not work and the second to the UN program did not seem to say what they said it does. In fact this is in their executive summary:

**“There is no sign of GHG emissions peaking in the next few years; every year of postponed peaking means that deeper and faster cuts will be required. By 2030, emissions would need to be 25 per cent and 55 per cent lower than in 2018 to put the world on the least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to below 2˚C and 1.5°C respectively”**

In addition I think it is well known that the IEA is known to have ties to the fossil fuel industry and consistently underestimate renewable energy. Wikipedia gives a list of criticisms of the organization.

I have run across Justin Ritchie before and know he downplays the threat of global warming. However the organization he works for (Breakthrough) issued a report in 2018 titled “Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach” which states the following:

**With the commitments by nations to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the current path of warming is 3°C or more  by 2100. But this figure does not include “long-term” carbon-cycle feedbacks, which are literally relevant now and in the near future due to the unprecedented rate at which human activity is perturbing the climate system. Taking these into account, the Paris path would lead to around 5°C of warming by 2100.**

You might want to take a look as it seems not everyone at Breakthrough shares his more relaxed attitude towards climate change.

The rest of your reply seems to just be twitter opinion comments so I’m going to stop commenting and ask you some questions.

From what I’ve read the IPCC reports are conservative. I’ll define conservative as those that don’t think climate change is that bad and progressives that think it is very bad. What I’ve read is that the report cannot be issued until every participant has agreed and the conservatives will fight to reduce the amount of alarm in the report whereas the progressives are so concerned about the climate that they will agree to less alarm to just get the report out and then try to comment in the press about how it is worse than being reported. With that as background, why is it that every ICPP report has been more and more confident that climate change is a danger to mankind and every report plays catchup by reporting it is worse than thought in the last report? Just like the AR6 is saying.

Why does the CO2 PPM continue to go up at an exponential rate even when emissions are lower like in 2020? Could it be we have already passed some tipping points and other factors are now adding CO2 or the oceans are getting saturated and cannot absorb as much CO2?

Do you see any evidence that countries will reduce their CO2 emissions enough to meet the goals necessary to start reducing CO2 PPM increases? I’m not talking about commitments, I’m talking about actual reductions.

If CO2 PPM in the atmosphere continues to increase is there some time in the future when you will admit it is really bad and too late to change without drastic economic measures?

My point being I think it's time we started taking some pretty drastic measures in order to make that happen now. That's not to say we have to destroy or even damage the economy but to make changes in government that require rapid movements from fossil fuels to non-polluting fuels. After all how much benefit would it be to business to have free energy sources instead of paying for fossil fuels and then paying to remove the by-products of fossil fuels. And how many lives would be extended by reducing pollution caused by fossil fuels. And even more exasperating to me, what gives companies the right to take the public's air, use it to produce products for profit, and then dump it back out into the atmosphere polluted. And I'm not even talking about CO2 but it also is a problem. How would you feel about a company next door to you that said they wanted to use your living room as a toilet so they could make more money by not building their own toilet? You really can't get around the fact that they are basically using the public's atmosphere as a toilet and making money by not cleaning their own mess up.",Im just going to touch on a few points in

,"The greening of planet Earth absorbs CO2 !!


Amid all the talk of an imminent planetary catastrophe caused by emissions of carbon dioxide, another fact is often ignored: global greening is happening faster than climate change. The amount of vegetation growing on the earth has been increasing every year for at least 30 years. The evidence comes from the growth rate of plants and from satellite data.
In 2016 a paper was published by 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries that analysed satellite data and concluded that there had been a roughly 14% increase in green vegetation over 30 years. The study attributed 70% of this increase to the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The lead author on the study, Zaichun Zhu of Beijing University, says this is equivalent to adding a new continent of green vegetation twice the size of the mainland United States.
Global greening has affected all ecosystems – from arctic tundra to coral reefs to plankton to tropical rain forests – but shows up most strongly in arid places like the Sahel region of Africa, where desertification has largely now reversed. This is because plants lose less water in the process of absorbing carbon dioxide if the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher. Ecosystems and farms will be less water-stressed at the end of this century than they are today during periods of low rainfall.
There should have been no surprise about this news. Thousands of experiments have been conducted over many years in which levels of CO2 had been increased over crops or wild ecosystems and boosted their growth. The owners of commercial greenhouses usually pump CO2 into the air to speed up the growth of plants. CO2 is plant food.
This greening is good news. It means more food for insects and deer, for elephants and mice, for fish and whales. It means higher yields for farmers; indeed, the effect has probably added about $3 trillion to farm incomes over the last 30 years. So less land is needed to feed the human population and more can be spared for wildlife instead.
Yet this never gets mentioned. In their desperation to keep the fearmongering on track the activists who make a living off the climate change scare do their best to ignore this inconvenient truth. When they cannot avoid the subject, they say that greening is a temporary phenomenon that will reverse in the latter part of this century. The evidence for this claim comes from a few models fed with extreme assumptions, so it cannot be trusted.
This biological phenomenon can also help to explain the coming and going of ice ages. It has always been a puzzle that ice ages grow gradually colder for tens of thousands of years, then suddenly warmer again in the space of a few thousand years, at which point the huge ice caps of Eurasia and North America collapse and the world enters a warmer interlude, such as the one we have been enjoying for 10,000 years.
Attempts to explain this cyclical pattern have mostly failed so far. Carbon dioxide levels track the change, but these rise after the world starts to warm and fall after the world starts to cool, so they are not the cause. Changes in the shape of the earth’s orbit play a role, with ice sheets collapsing when the northern summers are especially warm, but only some of these so-called “great summers” result in deglaciation.
Recent ice cores from the Antarctic appear to have fingered the culprit at last: it’s all about plants. During ice ages, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere steadily drops, because colder oceans absorb more of the gas. Eventually it reaches such a low level – about 0.018% at the peak of the last ice age – that plants struggle to grow at all, especially in dry areas or at high altitudes. As a result gigantic dust storms blanket the entire planet, reaching even Antarctica, where the amount of dust in the ice spikes dramatically upward. These dust storms blacken the northern ice sheets in particular, making them highly vulnerable to rapid melting when the next great summer arrives. The ice age was a horrible time to be alive even in the tropics: cold, dry, dusty and far less plant life than today.
As Svante Arrhenius, the Swede who first measured the greenhouse effect, said: “By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates.” Enjoy the lush greenery of the current world and enjoy the fact that green vegetation is changing faster than global average temperatures.",The greening of planet Earth

largely now reversed This is because plants lose less water in the process of absorbing carbon dioxide if the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher Ecosystems and farms will be less waterstressed at the end of this century than they are today during periods of low rainfall There should have been no surprise about this news Thousands of experiments have been conducted over many years in which levels of CO had been increased over crops or wild ecosystems and boosted their growth The owners of commercial greenhouses usually pump CO into the air to speed up the growth of plants CO is plant food This greening is good news It means more food for insects and deer for elephants and mice for fish and whales It means higher yields for farmers indeed the effect has probably added about trillion to farm incomes over the last years So less land is needed to feed the human population and more can be spared for wildlife instead Yet this never gets mentioned In their desperation to keep the fearmongering on track the activists who make a living off the climate change scare do their best to ignore this inconvenient truth When they cannot avoid the subject they say that greening is a temporary phenomenon that will reverse in the latter part of this century The evidence for this claim comes from a few models fed with extreme assumptions so it cannot be trusted This biological phenomenon can also help to explain the coming and going of ice ages It has always been a puzzle that ice ages grow gradually colder for tens of thousands of years then suddenly warmer again in the space of a few thousand years at which point the huge ice caps of Eurasia and North America collapse and the world enters a warmer interlude such as the one we have been enjoying for years Attempts to explain this cyclical pattern have mostly failed so far Carbon dioxide levels track the change but these rise after the world starts to warm and fall after the world starts to cool so they are not the cause Changes in the shape of the earths orbit play a role with ice sheets collapsing when the northern summers are especially warm but only some of these socalled great summers result in deglaciation Recent ice cores from the Antarctic appear to have fingered the culprit at last its all about plants During ice ages the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere steadily drops because colder oceans absorb more of the gas Eventually it reaches such a low level about at the peak of the last ice age that plants struggle to grow at all especially in dry areas or at high altitudes As a result gigantic dust storms blanket the entire planet reaching even Antarctica where the amount of dust in the ice spikes dramatically upward These dust storms blacken the northern ice sheets in particular making them highly vulnerable to rapid melting when the next great summer arrives The ice age was a horrible time to be alive even in the tropics cold dry dusty and far less plant life than today As Svante Arrhenius the Swede who first measured the greenhouse effect said By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable

,"Yes, there are two ways they can help long term.

The first is just permanently increasing the amount of forested land below a certain latitude ( if they stop snow, they lower albedo and warm the Earth ... https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tropical-forests-cool-earth/ ).  Right now 3 trillion trees store 400 gigatons of carbon.  Another trillion trees could store another 133 gigatons.  We emit 37 gigatons per year, so an extra trillion trees stores 3.5 years worth of emissions.

The second way is using trees (and actually any photosynthetic organism) to use sunlight to turn CO2 into something less gaseous (wood or other plant matter, calcium carbonite, etc) and then processing the result to stabilize the carbon for at least millennia ( e.g., using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis ).  Trees are pretty slow growing, so to actually offset the 37 gigatons of emissions, you'd probably need to do something like this http://carbon.ycombinator.com/ocean-phytoplankton/ .

A: The carbon cycle.

Trees don't permanently sequester the carbon they capture. It's reintroduced to the atmosphere through decomposition.

>Here we document a regional-scale shift in stock–recruitment relationships of corals along the Great Barrier Reef—the world’s largest coral reef system—following unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching events caused by global warming. As a consequence of mass mortality of adult brood stock in 2016 and 2017 owing to heat stress[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1081-y#ref-CR6), the amount of larval recruitment declined in 2018 by 89% compared to historical levels. For the first time, brooding pocilloporids replaced spawning acroporids as the dominant taxon in the depleted recruitment pool. The collapse in stock–recruitment relationships indicates that the low resistance of adult brood stocks to repeated episodes of coral bleaching is inexorably tied to an impaired capacity for recovery, which highlights the multifaceted processes that underlie the global decline of coral reefs. The extent to which the Great Barrier Reef will be able to recover from the collapse in stock–recruitment relationships remains uncertain, given the projected increased frequency of extreme climate events over the next two decades[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1081-y#ref-CR7).

,"**Pyrolysis**

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It involves a change of chemical composition and is irreversible. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro ""fire"" and lysis ""separating"".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials.

I disagree. Every positive bit of difference, no matter how small, always means less CO2 enters the atmosphere which is an inherently good thing. Admittedly, we do need large scale changes to our different infrastructure systems in order to meet targets but never downplay the effect that millions of people pursuing positive action can have in moving the world towards a brighter future.

,"Firstly, the idea that those who deny the mountain of evidence that global warming is real and it's due to human activity are actual skeptics is kinda funny. Scientists are skeptics. People who cite random blog posts from people who've taken money from the fossil fuel industry to promote the idea that there's a ""debate"" in the scientific world about the reality of global warming are not skeptics. For them, denial of the science has become their religion. They post YouTube videos and link to blog posts that ""prove global warming isn't real"" without offering any scientific evidence for the same. Or they link to a paper that's been proven to be invalid due to its methodology or its conclusions don't follow the evidence presented. I can post a link to a blog that assures me that, due to astrological conditions, the weather three years from now will be fine. I can cite a book that will tell you in no uncertain terms that vaccinations cause autism. Neither contain evidence that hasn't already been thoroughly debunked. 

Because science isn't done on YouTube or blog posts. Science is done through peer reviewed articles published in reputable journals. As mentioned elsewhere, that doesn't necessarily mean those articles are fully accessible. That said, there are plenty of resources available for free if you care to look.

It's unfortunate that you were met with personal attacks. Equally unfortunate is that the deniers engage in similar tactics.

The problem is that what you're looking for is a little hard to find. You're looking for evidence that both sides could be right. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as that. I am sure there are scientists looking for some way to prove that the CO2 and methane we're dumping into the atmosphere is NOT having an effect on the climate. That it's something else. Or that the climate isn't as sensitive to a doubling in CO2 as what multiple studies seem to indicate. 

Unfortunately, at the moment, it seems to be the case that a) the man-made CO2 and CH4 are the main drivers of the current warming trend and b) that a doubling of CO2 will result in a warming of roughly 3 degrees centigrade.

,"Your selective quoting is fun, but a gish-gallop is not evidence. But hey, you've provided, so lets go.

Sure, if someone were to look at your quotes in isolation they might come to the conclusion that the IPCC don't know what the hell they're talking about. But that's not the case, is it?

Anyway, you wrote:

>For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. 

But here's the full quote ([https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR\_AR5\_FINAL\_full\_wcover.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf) p48):

>Over every continental region except Antarctica, anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century (Figure 1.10). For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. In contrast, it is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial Arctic warming since the mid-20th century. Human influence has likely contributed to temperature increases in many sub-continental regions. {WGI SPM D.3, TS.4.8, 10.3.1} 

That's a bit different isn't it? So for every continental region, the report is more than 66% (because that's what ""likely"" means in the context of the report) sure that the temperature increases are due to human activity. 

You seem quite hung up about the uncertainties involved with Antarctica. That's okay, nothing against that, but it's not the whole report.

You also wrote:

>There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale

But following that (and thus providing more nuance) was:

>The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by a lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments, making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult. However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding on a regional scale (medium confidence). Costs related to flood damage, worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets. {WGI 2.6.2, WGII 3.2.7, SREX SPM B}

And again for long term changes in tropical cyclone activity. The full quote:

>There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic since 1970. {WGI Table SPM.1, 2.6.3, 10.6}

Did you forget to leave that part out? Or did you just not like it because it doesn't fit with the vision of yourself as an educator of ""alarmists""?

You quote an excerpt about rising sea levels:

>it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century

But leave out the fact that this is about risk management. The full quote:

>For example, it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century, but the consequence of a greater rise could be so severe that this possibility becomes a significant part of risk assessment. Similarly, low confidence but high consequence outcomes are also policy relevant; for instance the possibility that the response of Amazon forest could substantially amplify climate change merits consideration despite our currently imperfect ability to project the outcome. (2.4, Table 2.3) {WGI Table 13.5, WGII SPM A-3, 4.4, Box 4-3, WGIII Box 3-9, SYR Glossary

And again, in relation to droughts, there's low confidence due to direct observations. But the quote is more extensive than that:

>There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations, dependencies of inferred trends on the choice of the definition for drought, and due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There is also low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th century, due to the same observational uncertainties and difficulties in distinguishing decadal scale variability in drought from long-term trends. {WGI Table SPM.1, [2.6.2.3](https://2.6.2.3), 10.6, Figure 2.33, WGII [3.ES](https://3.ES), 3.2.7}

When the IPCC says ""low confidence"" they're not saying it doesn't happen. They're saying that the evidence is limited and there's no agreement on what that limited data is telling us. Or that there may be some agreement, but still a lack of evidence. (See: [https://wg1.ipcc.ch/AR6/documents/AR5\_Uncertainty\_Guidance\_Note.pdf](https://wg1.ipcc.ch/AR6/documents/AR5_Uncertainty_Guidance_Note.pdf))

You said: 

>So the IPCC itself says that there are no more flooding, hurricanes, droughts due to our Co2 emissions. They acknowledge that the Antarctic ice is constant or even growing. And the sea level will not rise a meaningful amount even in the next eighty years

But the IPCC did **NOT** say that. They variously said:

* we don't have enough information to say with any degree of certainty that tropical cyclones are increasing, but we're 99% certain that there are more storms in the North Atlantic
* we don't have enough data to be able to say that droughts are increasing but it's due to a number of factors, not the least of which is the definition of drought
* ""Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass (high confidence)"" (p42, sn. 1.1.3 Cryosphere)
* that while sea level rise is unlikely (i.e. between 0 and 33%) the risk posed to people, societies economic sectors and ecosystems is still there

Again you misrepresent what the report says when you state:

>AR5 has a temperature graph SPM1a on page 3, where the temperature seems to have increased about 0.6 degrees C between 1951 and 2010, and basically they do not know how much of that is human caused, but it may be no more than half, so 0.6\*0.5 = 0.3 degrees C. That is a far cry from the 0.9 degrees that the earth has warmed since 1850 according to the instrumental record, the IPCC is only claiming a third of this for ""anthropocentric"" Co2 emissions!

You cite SPM1a, and yet the report clearly states:

>The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 \[0.65 to 1.06\] °C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist (Figure SPM.1a). {1.1.1, Figure 1.1}

The same report you cite explains your ""more than half"" distortion and fantasy math quite clearly:

>It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together (Figure 1.9). **The best estimate of the human induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period**. GHGs contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3°C over the period 1951 to 2010, with further contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, from natural forcings, and from natural internal variability (see Figure 1.9).

Summary: All the warming seen is there because of humans and that's *after taking into account the negative forcing we've introduced through the addition of aerosols*. How'd you miss that?",Your selective quoting is fun but a gishgallop is not evidence But hey youve provided so lets go Sure if someone were to look at your quotes in isolation they might come to the

> The Getz region of West Antarctica is losing ice at an increasing rate; however, the forcing mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use satellite observations and an ice sheet model to measure the change in ice speed and mass balance of the drainage basin over the last 25-years. Our results show a mean increase in speed of 23.8 % between 1994 and 2018, with three glaciers accelerating by over 44 %. Speedup across the Getz basin is linear, with speedup and thinning directly correlated confirming the presence of dynamic imbalance.
>
> Since 1994, **315 Gt of ice has been lost contributing 0.9 ± 0.6 mm global mean sea level**, with increased loss since 2010 caused by a snowfall reduction. Overall, dynamic imbalance accounts for two thirds of the mass loss from this region of West Antarctica over the past 25-years, with a longer-term response to ocean forcing the likely driving mechanism.

EDIT: Annual average ice loss from Greenland has been 250 billion tons over the past decade, which makes sense when you consider that the average sea level rise is something like ~3.4 mm right now and Greenland amounts to around a quarter of it, or slightly less than 1 mm.

> From the 1970s through the early 1990s, the Greenland Ice Sheet was roughly in balance, with mass gains equaling mass losses. In the mid‐1990s, however, Greenland ice loss began and accelerated. By combining ~1985–2015 records of changing outlet glacier flow, ice edge positions, and ice sheet surface elevation, we show that the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet is undergoing a significant reconfiguration. Ice edge retreat is ubiquitous, with virtually no glaciers experiencing advance, while some areas of the ice sheet have sped up and others have slowed.
>
> Our observations reveal a rapid reconfiguration around the full ice sheet margin, with narrowing areas of fast ice flow, changes in the routing of ice flow, and glacier outlets that are likely being abandoned. The implications of rapid ice sheet reconfiguration are wide ranging. Water movement underneath the ice sheet likely changes, along with the quantity and timing of iceberg production and freshwater input to the ocean, affecting the nutrients and sediment transport from the ice sheet to local and regional ecosystems. Without detailed observations of earlier deglaciations and with limits on ice sheet computer simulation capabilities, these observational records provide an important analogue for past deglaciation and for projecting future ice loss.

> The map below illustrates the geographical spread of surface mass losses (red shading) and gains (blue) over 2019-20 compared to the long-term average. In general, the map reveals more losses on the western side of Greenland over the past year and gains in the east.
Map shows the difference between the annual SMB in 2019-20 and the 1981-2010 period (in mm of ice melt). Blue shows more ice gain than average and red shows more ice loss than average.

> But this is only half of the story. **To get the total mass balance, we must also factor in the losses of ice from the breaking off, or “calving”, of icebergs and from ocean melting at its edge. Including these processes gives a total mass loss of 152bn tonnes for the year**.

,">It shows a rapid rise initially the from about 6,000 years ago the trend has been flat with consistent variations

Your opinion seems to be based on data that disagrees with current paleoclimate reconstructions.

Kaufman et al. (2020) \[1\] shows that a long term cooling trend has dominated the global temperature record for the last 6000 years or so, with the exception of the last century and a half. See [figure 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7/figures/3) for instance.

Can you provide your source that shows otherwise? I'd be interested to see it.

>After the hot year of 1998 the IPCC adopted Manns hockey stick curve and appended the prediction to the historical data

This is quite a confusing sentence and prompts a number of questions

* Why is a hot year important to a long term trend?
* How exactly does one ""append a prediction"" to a global temperature reconstruction. The hockey stick was not projecting anything and was a multi-measurement reconstruction that included proxies and the instrumental temperature record
* Are you under the impression that there is a large conspiracy involving thousands of scientists that's aimed at convincing us that temperatures are rising when they're actually not? If so, to what end?

As above, I'm really interested in the answers.

>I began following the climate debate around this time and read quite a few publications by authors who disagree with the predictions

Again, many questions

* What predictions are you talking about? Were these predictions presented in scientific papers?
* Which publications did you read? Were they scientific publications? Were they blogs?
* Given that this occurred in the late 90's and early 2000's, has your opinion changed as scientific evidence has mounted? Or are you still reading these ""publications by authors who disagree"" with the large body of evidence?

>These reinforced my skepticism of the dire consequences of CO2

Are you under the impression that CO2 is *not* causing the rapid warming trend we've seen since the Industrial Revolution? If so, can you please explain what's driving the warming?

I'm curious because a number of your posts - and this one - seem to rely heavily on opinion rather than empirical evidence. I hope you understand that opinion - no matter how heartfelt - isn't particularly relevant when it comes to discussing objective facts. In particular:

* The earth is warming
* It's due to human emissions of CO2
* It's happening more rapidly than at any time in the last 11,000 years
* The consequences for large parts of the earth and a significant proportion of the human population are likely to be - to put it mildly - quite bad

I could go on, but this serves to highlight the fact that these conclusions are based on science, whereas yours appears to be solely your opinion. Or possibly the opinion of the bloggers and reporters and authors of articles that you read that aren't basing their opinions on science either. It's hard to tell.

,">You are drawing a long bow claiming l am putting civilisation and your children at a dramatic risk because l expect the sea level rise to remain relatively consistent over the next 30 years as it has been since measurements were taken.

It’s a lot more than just sea level rise. And sea level rise has not been consistent. It’s been rising exponentially over the past 45 years.

>Maybe l should suggest you consider my previous comments regarding measurement errors when you conclude that sea level rise will accelerate to 6 or 7 times the recent historically rate.

Sea level rise is measured with tidal gauges and satellites which agree on the amount of rise. In addition it can be approximated by measurements of ice melts and temperature rise which validates the direct measurements. So trying to say the measurements are off by 200% is just desperation on your part.

What historically rate are you talking about. It appears to be about 100 years. So why didn’t you pick 200 years or 1000 years or 30,000 years. What’s magic about 100 years. The most recent historical rate is the past 5 years or at least since satellites have been used for measurements. What’s wrong with that historical rate?

Using the past 100 years for calculating the rate is like riding in a car that is going 60 MPH and saying will it’s really only going 30 MPH because we started at 0 MPH when we were not moving. That’s not going to help a bit if you have a head on collision.

>I'm all for individuals contributing their efforts and resources to support their own ideals. As l do. But l think when it comes to our governments or institutions, l think there are more important issues to concentrate on than a variation in CO2 concentrations.

It doesn’t matter to the truth at all what people think. What matters is the evidence. And the evidence shows that destructive weather has already started and will only get worse causing catastrophic disruptions in financial losses along with human death and devastation.

Scientists have been saying for years that the IPCC is too conservative. Now the latest report from scientists around the world that just came out yesterday has finally gotten up to speed on how bad and how rapidly global warming is happening and that mankind will ignore it at it’s peril.

>I look from the outside at US, European and other Western politics and cultures and l see these deteriorating, seemingly unobserved, while they pursue a variety of ideological that are inevitably a consequence of fossil fuels. But only the cost and not the benefits.

That shows the graph is only about the Indian subcontinent. In addition the graph shows a temperature difference of up to 4C over the past 10k years and only climate deniers would believe that since the glacial periods only show a global 5-7C change from the interglacial periods.

>\-l'm sure you have claimed before that the LIA and the medieval warm period and other variations were only local as well. If you suggest that the variations shown on this chart are only local as well, you should ask yourself why they coincide.

There is not a scientific consensus on the reason or extent of the cold period. However at this time the best evidence suggest it was a combination of a long volcano eruption and a decrease in the suns radiation. It appears the drop in temperature was around 1C in Europe and it’s not clear if it was worldwide or not.

,"From Wikipedia, on the book I am guessing you are referring 

""While the book is not focused on solutions, it recognizes solutions exist to prevent the worst of the damages: ""a carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy; a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet; and public investment in green energy and carbon capture"".[""

,"That's speculative on human nature.   I wouldn't say ""definitely"" either way. Emissions are increasing, but activism is increasing too.  Bills to reduce emissions are being discussed, green energy has never been more popular and imo most importantly we have a generation of young people who understand their future is being destroyed.  Climate science is becoming more mainstream, more people are aware - I think there is a chance we do mitigate and give this existential threat the attention and resources it deserves. There is also a chance we won't. We are creatures of comfort, for sure. But we also are programmed to survive. With how many events are in the news now, I think the pressure for meaningful change will only increase.   What I think bears repeating though is that climate doom or apocalyptic certainty is another method used to promote climate inaction - it's slowly shifting from denial, to ""it's too late anyway so don't bother"" - which is just a new flavor of the same disinformation.",Thats speculative on human nature I wouldnt say definitely either way Emissions are increasing but activism is increasing too Bills to reduce emissions are being discussed green energy has never been more popular and imo most importantly we have a generation of young people who understand their future is being destroyed Climate science is becoming more mainstream more people are aware I think there is a chance we do mitigate and give this existential threat the attention and resources it deserves There is also a chance we wont We are creatures of comfort for sure But we also are programmed to survive With how many events are in the news now I think the pressure for meaningful change will only increase What I think bears repeating though is that climate doom or apocalyptic certainty is another method used to promote climate inaction its slowly shifting from denial to its too late anyway so dont bother which is just a new flavor of the same disinformation,165,certainty bills repeating also people news apocalyptic promote never another science shifting disinformation deserves energy nature say existential slowly late reduce activism understand pressure events future chance increase anyway threat increasing generation mainstream resources meaningful emissions speculative way discussed destroyed aware thats becoming give creatures popular many wont young importantly wouldnt either mitigate method though think climate programmed bears imo survive sure doom used dont inaction denial bother definitely human flavor change comfort green new attention
,"I can see you have a very strong belief of this, but I offer just a few final points 

1) make sure your belief is rooted in the science itself. Good or bad doesn't matter, the veracity of the claims is what matters. It's easy to both downplay or to exaggerate to hyperbole on what is going on - news articles are meant for clicks, not education. A downside of this is that negativity is much easier to sell than positivity, especially in this realm. And the current situation makes that easy - in fact it's hard to overstate the issues we will face - but that is all the more reason to make sure you are rooted in the science itself and not editorialized stories in either direction.

2) progress can be made. I will point again to the growing industry for green energy and the climate action even manchin has signed on for (it's not enough, of course , but it's a start) that meaningful change can haplen and is happening. The only way to ensure that meaningful change doesn't happen is to give up and say it's too late anyway.",I can see you have a very strong belief of this but I offer just a few final points make sure your belief is rooted in the science itself Good or bad doesnt matter the veracity of the claims is what matters Its easy to both downplay or to exaggerate to hyperbole on what is going on news articles are meant for clicks not education A downside of this is that negativity is much easier to sell than positivity especially in this realm And the current situation makes that easy in fact its hard to overstate the issues we will face but that is all the more reason to make sure you are rooted in the science itself and not editorialized stories in either direction progress can be made I will point again to the growing industry for green energy and the climate action even manchin has signed on for its not enough of course but its a start that meaningful change can haplen and is happening The only way to ensure that meaningful change doesnt happen is to give up and say its too late anyway,187,doesnt situation reason negativity progress even news veracity belief happen science easy downplay overstate energy start action say meant education hyperbole issues enough direction late course see realm bad clicks industry claims make fact growing anyway manchin happening meaningful makes matters much positivity way strong good signed give face final made either current matter exaggerate climate especially hard sure articles downside stories going change point offer points editorialized haplen green easier rooted ensure sell

,"I'm very Independent, politically. In some ways I lean very Conservative, in others I'm a ""bleeding-heart liberal.""  I have no problems talking to Conservatives about anything. Generally, even when they disagree, I can have a civil conversation where each of us gets to make our points, and often we find that we agree more than we disagree.

When I talk to Liberals about anything they deem to be a Conservative issue, I generally find that they attack, then shut down any opposing argument with insults.

On the subject of Climate Change, I find that most Liberals' grasp of the situation is ""Carbon is bad, because Scientists say so, and you're not smarter than Scientists.""  This is a pretty weak debating tactic, being a classic Logical Fallacy, but that's where we are.  Oh, there are plenty of Conservatives who's best argument is ""it's all a hoax"" or ""the scientists are all in it for the money"" or something.  Just as bad, just as clueless.

Still, if you MUST try to talk to Conservatives about climate change, do it with a clear goal in mind.  Are you trying to convince them that GHGs are really warming the planet?  Know what you're talking about, then. Don't try to bully them with Scientists say so.

Seriously, millions of Liberals want change, but would fail a physics test questioning the science behind atmospheric radiation absorption and emission. They don't know why, but they argue as if you're stupid for not believing something they themselves don't understand.  If you want a Conservative to change what he is personally doing, you've got to give him good reasons for changing his behavior.  If you just want him to vote for your candidate, Climate Change is not going to be your best platform.",Im very Independent politically In some ways I lean very Conservative in others Im a bleedingheart liberal I have no problems talking to Conservatives about anything Generally even when they disagree I can have a civil conversation where each of us gets to make our points and often we find that we agree more than we disagree When I talk to Liberals about anything they deem to be a Conservative issue I generally find that they attack then shut down any opposing argument with insults On the subject of Climate Change I find that most Liberals grasp of the situation is Carbon is bad because Scientists say so and youre not smarter than Scientists This is a pretty weak debating tactic being a classic Logical Fallacy but thats where we are Oh there are plenty of Conservatives whos best argument is its all a hoax or the scientists are all in it for the money or something Just as bad just as clueless Still if you MUST try to talk to Conservatives about climate change do it with a clear goal in mind Are you trying to convince them that GHGs are really warming the planet Know what youre talking about then Dont try to bully them with Scientists say so Seriously millions of Liberals want change but would fail a physics test questioning the science behind atmospheric radiation absorption and emission They dont know why but they argue as if youre stupid for not believing something they themselves dont understand If you want a Conservative to change what he is personally doing youve got to give him good reasons for changing his behavior If you just want him to vote for your candidate Climate Change is not going to be your best platform,294,problems bleedingheart issue vote behavior scientists millions generally money changing still fallacy make insults fail radiation thats give best gets tactic climate try clueless dont trying stupid opposing reasons believing pretty even logical argue say know conversation oh platform argument mind weak youre something atmospheric us good attack subject politically want talk would going points goal behind often convince situation must smarter others personally find science anything bad lean agree ghgs conservative clear really hoax plenty seriously shut independent change emission planet civil talking absorption liberal physics whos bully youve candidate questioning test warming got liberals disagree understand deem im grasp conservatives debating classic carbon ways

,"Can you show me actual science that shows average storm energy has increased over the last 1000 years?  Short term changes (last 30 years) are not convincing, because we know that there were horrific storm cycles 60 years ago, or 100 years ago, etc.

We also know that horrific droughts have occurred more than 30 years in the past. The Dust Bowl drought that caused the great migration out of the central plains of the US to California occurred before we started really ramping up CO2 emissions. Half of the emissions we've ever emitted have occurred after the year 2000, and yet we had droughts and hurricanes and ice storms and killing heat waves well before then.

Also, history may well have ignored terrible weather systems back over 150 years ago in places that were sparsely populated. Why ""study"" storms that occur in places where only a couple of hundred people live, when we've got hundreds of thousands living on the coast?

So, focusing on ""a wild storm"" and insinuating that it's mankind's fault that the storm is bad is really just short term thinking, without any actual science to back it up.

And yeah, I know we have droughts.  We have areas of the US now that are in drought.

Here’s a Mega-List of reputable sources proving climate change is very real.,"EDIT: I suppose the title should say “proving that humans are causing climate change.” 

——

I recently encountered a climate change denier in the wild and thought, “You know what, there are plenty of reputable sources out there that agree that climate change is real and being caused by humans. I’m going to collect a list of those sources and show them to this person.”

So I did, and I wanted to share this mega list with you, to better arm you to help people accept what is happening to our planet. So here goes:

,"The problem with just calling it climate change is that people will latch onto how the climate has always been changing, which is true. What most people don't realize is that when we talk about climate change today, what we are referring to is anthropogenic climate change. I really, really think that in order to start changing some people's views is to change from just calling it climate change and call it by it's true name. That way the distinction between the two is made and is harder to deny. I could be wrong but it's worth a try.

,"Sources are nice, but there are plenty of reputable sources that claim the opposite. The only thing to be proven is that there is no agreement on the issue. Also, using snopes or the U.S senate as reputable sources seems very dumb. 

https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf

"" For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. ""

"" There is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent due to the incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change and low confidence in estimates of natural internal variability in that region ""

"" There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale ""

"" There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations ""

"" There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause ""

"" it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century, ""

So the IPCC itself says that there are no more flooding, hurricanes, droughts due to our Co2 emissions. They acknowledge that the Antarctic ice is constant or even growing. And the sea level will not rise a meaningful amount even in the next eighty years.

But there is more:

It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.

AR5 has a temperature graph SPM1a on page 3, where the temperature seems to have increased about 0.6 degrees C between 1951 and 2010, and basically they do not know how much of that is human caused, but it may be no more than half, so 0.6*0.5 = 0.3 degrees C. That is a far cry from the 0.9 degrees that the earth has warmed since 1850 according to the instrumental record, the IPCC is only claiming a third of this for ""anthropocentric"" Co2 emissions!

So what about the future?Well for the future temperature scenarios they need to use their models. But:

"" For the period from 1998 to 2012, 111 of the 114 available climate-model simulations show a surface warming trend larger than the observations (Box 1.1, Figure 1a). ""

So the IPCC themselves acknowledge that the models are running hot.

The IPCC has a separate section on the their model quality, .and they state

""The causes of both the observed GMST trend hiatus and of the model–observation GMST trend difference during 1998–2012 imply that, barring a major volcanic eruption, most 15-year GMST trends in the near-term future will be larger than during 1998–2012 (high confidence; see 11.3.6.3. for a full assessment of near-term projections of GMST). The reasons for this implication are fourfold: first, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas concentrations are expected to rise further in all RCP scenarios; second, anthropogenic aerosol concentration is expected to decline in all RCP scenarios, and so is the resulting cooling effect; third, the trend in solar forcing is expected to be larger over most near-term 15-year periods than over 1998–2012 (medium confidence), because 1998–2012 contained the full downward phase of the solar cycle; and fourth, it is more likely than not that internal climate variability in the near-term will enhance and not counteract the surface warming expected to arise from the increasing anthropogenic forcing. ""

So the IPCC have issued a very concrete short term prediction for the global warming from 2012 to about 2025-2030 where they are basically doubling down on the validity of the high co2-sensitivity of their models, and even using the term ""high confidence"". If global warming from 2012 to 2025 does not get back to the pace predicted by the models, then you can use the IPCCs own statements (""high confidence"") to refute them, they have really put their reputation and credibility on the line.

I feel like when talking to alarmists, I spend alot of time basically arguing to try to convince alarmists of things that I now realize the IPCC has already stated. I guess this is probably because noone actually reads the IPCC reports. So a good tip is to just quote the IPCC for these claims.

tl;dr:

The jist of the IPCC report is that they acknowledge that nothing much has happend yet, and even less of what has happend can be attributed to CO2, and the dire predictions rest solely on models that they themselves acknowledge are running too hot.",Sources are nice but there are plenty of reputable sources that claim the opposite The only thing to be proven is that there is no agreement on the

,"No. Within the consensus that anthropogenic climate change is occurring is a wide range of ideas about where we are headed with our current trajectory. My bias is toward crisis.

,">The scientists conducted the study by pulling together global data sets tracking major carbon dioxide sources like power plants, vehicles, industrial boilers, and residential appliances such as furnaces and stoves. Together, they’d pump out about 660 billion additional metric tons of greenhouse gases from this point forward, well above the 580 billion tons that mark the top end of the estimated range for limiting warming to 1.5 ˚C.

Useful to have a firm number estimate on this. 

>Power facilities already in the pipeline—“planned, permitted, or under construction”—would emit nearly 200 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, the researchers found. Most of those impending facilities are in China, India, and the rest of the developing world.

>Emissions from existing systems plus these planned plants would add up to about 850 billion tons, closing in on the carbon budget for 2 ˚C, which runs between 1,170 and 1,500 billion tons.

More useful numbers. 

>But there’s little indication that nations, particularly in the developing world, will suddenly stop building fossil-fuel plants after completing what’s in the pipeline.

Kind of an abrupt end to an article like this, but okay.

Are these numbers sufficient motivation to get people focusing on local climate adaptations, given that emissions limits aren't going to be effective in this scenario?

I think probably not. But the local adaptations will continue to happen anyway, out of the glare of major public attention.

> If these components of the existing energy system operate for as long as they have historically, and we build all the new power facilities already planned, they&#039;ll emit about two thirds of the carbon dioxide necessary to crank up global temperatures by 2 ?C.If fractions of a degree don&#039;t sound that dramatic, consider that 1.5 ?C of warming could already be enough to expose 14% of the global population to bouts of severe heat, melt nearly 2 million square miles of Arctic permafrost, and destroy more than 70% of the world&#039;s coral reefs.

Yes the ""TThe"" typo is on the website you linked! 

No it is not 0.85ºC, IPCC data says:

,"Not sure what the comment you responded to said since it is deleted but I can actually speak to this. It is relevant to my job & everything. 

Vertical farms definitely use energy. No question. 

But generally speaking, growing typical crops in a vertical farming environment would require significantly less energy than indoor cannabis cultivation. 

Both would require energy for lighting & various other elements. Cannabis cultivation has begun using very sophisticated lighting made specifically for cannabis but let’s not even dwell on that since all the lighting is going to be LED in either application. 

Cannabis requires a *much* more controlled environment. 

Vertical farming can also require such, but so far the trend is generally to utilize existing structures & not depend on a very controlled environment. Many vertical farms are actually open air facilities without exterior walls. 

Cannabis is usually cultivated in facilities constructed with insulated metal panels (think refrigerator panels) which require steel facing, steel or aluminum extrusions, & a core material (such as polyisocyanurate). All of this traditionally requires significant amounts of CO2 to create. Even if you’re using largely recycled aluminum. 

Think of it this way, you can grow food crops pretty much anywhere (more or less). Cannabis is grown in the same facilities used for pharmaceutical cleanrooms. 

This is because again, cannabis needs a much more controlled environment without excess moisture, uncontrolled temps, specific air flow, etc. 

I’m not up to speed on the specifics of the energy usage, but I would be willing to bet that the power needed for a cannabis specific HVAC/filtration system is as much as is created by the lighting systems if not significantly more. 

Vertical crop farming generally does not need said level of air control. Saving a huge energy cost. 

This is not to mention that cannabis cultivation is WAY more than simply growing. There are many many ‘rooms’ or ‘environments’ involved. There are often 3 or 4 different controlled environments for growing stages plus a curing, trimming, & packaging facility. 

Crop cultivation is pretty much just grow & sometimes washing plus packaging. They may have two or three different environments for grow stages, but these don’t even require their own dedicated controlled environments many times. 

Sorry for rambling a bit. But I hope this helps demonstrate the difference. It is rather substantial from my understanding.",Not sure what the comment you responded to said since it is deleted but I can actually speak to this It is relevant to my job everything Vertical farms definitely use energy No question But generally speaking growing typical crops in a vertical farming environment would require significantly less energy than indoor cannabis cultivation Both would require energy for lighting various other elements Cannabis cultivation has begun using very sophisticated lighting made specifically for cannabis but lets not even dwell on that since all the lighting is going to be LED in either application Cannabis requires a much more controlled environment Vertical farming can also require such but so far the trend is generally to utilize existing structures not depend on a very controlled environment Many vertical farms are actually open air facilities without exterior walls Cannabis is usually cultivated in facilities constructed with insulated metal panels think refrigerator panels which require steel facing steel or aluminum extrusions a core material such as polyisocyanurate All of this traditionally requires significant amounts of CO to create Even if youre using largely recycled aluminum Think of it this way you can grow food crops pretty much anywhere more or less Cannabis is grown in the same facilities used for pharmaceutical cleanrooms This is because again cannabis needs a much more controlled environment without excess moisture uncontrolled temps specific air flow etc Im not up to speed on the specifics of the energy usage but I would be willing to bet that the power needed for a cannabis specific HVACfiltration system is as much as is created by the lighting systems if not significantly more Vertical crop farming generally does not need said level of air control Saving a huge energy cost This is not to mention that cannabis cultivation is WAY more than simply growing There are many many rooms or environments involved There are often or different controlled environments for growing stages plus a curing trimming packaging facility Crop cultivation is pretty much just grow sometimes washing plus packaging They may have two or three different environments for grow stages but these dont even require their own dedicated controlled environments many times Sorry for rambling a bit But I hope this helps demonstrate the difference It is rather substantial from my understanding,381,typical needed hvacfiltration packaging systems recycled temps environments facilities led need speed generally crop co everything dedicated grow open speak cultivation cannabis sorry crops much bit farming requires made cost sometimes lets three needs facing amounts difference facility dont existing understanding refrigerator usually different comment also moisture pretty even control helps anywhere relevant washing aluminum extrusions question growing insulated use youre less way plus various simply specifics controlled think environment speaking rambling depend sure would going constructed mention hope often structures metal dwell willing system largely responded indoor specifically uncontrolled times substantial energy trend may deleted specific create power pharmaceutical vertical sophisticated many excess far polyisocyanurate using either flow rather demonstrate farms stages walls significantly traditionally without begun require saving application said actually job curing etc bet elements since created material cultivated involved significant steel im lighting food two level exterior panels huge core air trimming utilize usage cleanrooms used grown definitely rooms

,"Thanks.  Good answer.

As far as I can tell VF is only a viable economic alternative when land is very expensive, product value high per pound dry weight, and product has a short growing cycle and is hard to transport, and product can use lots of hand labour.

Good examples would be lettuce, fresh herbs, possibly tomatoes.

If land is cheap, then green houses are cheaper.  

Products that get only 1 harvest a year (pears) are too expensive to produced.  Products that store well (wheat) are too much cheaper to grow in conventional farms.

The dryweight metric comes in due to energy cost per pound of carbohydrate produced.  Lettuce is 90% water so you are selling textured, flavoured water.  The energy cost is low per sales unit.",Thanks Good answer As far as I can tell VF is only a viable economic alternative when land is very expensive product value high per pound dry weight and product has a short growing cycle and is hard to transport and product can use lots of hand labour Good examples would be lettuce fresh herbs possibly tomatoes If land is cheap then green houses are cheaper Products that get only harvest a year pears are too expensive to produced Products that store well wheat are too much cheaper to grow in conventional farms The dryweight metric comes in due to energy cost per pound of carbohydrate produced Lettuce is water so you are selling textured flavoured water The energy cost is low per sales unit,125,economic lots viable product conventional vf pears value well textured high energy year store sales land comes selling cheap grow growing weight hand lettuce harvest wheat use cycle possibly get dryweight fresh much good due far tell expensive cost alternative carbohydrate low products flavoured per herbs hard labour farms cheaper water thanks unit answer would produced dry transport pound houses green metric examples short tomatoes

The polar ice caps are currently larger than when he made that “documentary”. It may shock you to know that he made tens of millions of dollars from that movie alone. Let that sink in- he made tens of millions of dollars by fearmongering and scaring gullible people like you.

,"This user seems to be your typical NPC climate denier:

* Thinks scientific consensus believed in global cooling in the 60's/80's. Shows they don't know about the fact that it was roughly split 50/50 and that we've known global warming would occur since at least the 1950's. 
* Claims that we're at record low temps somehow.
* Thinks ""global warming"" was changed to ""climate change."" Doesn't seem to know that global warming causes climate change.
* Points out throughout history that the planet as gone through periods of warming much higher than today, therefore it's natural (yet doesn't acknowledge extinction events occurring during this periods) so therefore there's nothing to worry about.
* Claims government groups that monitor the climate are fake groups.
* Claims that climate change is a hoax, specifically ""fake news.""
* Claims they want to help the environment.

Everything about this person screams that they get their science info from a combination of, but not exclusive to, Facebook, Fox News, WattsUpWithThat, youtube's algorithm, PragerU, maybe one or two libertarian think tanks, and probably any google searches that are along the lines of ""proof climate change is a hoax.""

,"Not necessarily. Sometimes, it can take years, decades, or centuries before ""everyone"" is on board the truth about an issue or idea. Some people never accept the truth before coming to the ends of their lives.        
        
For example, in the 6th century BC, Greek philosopher and mathematician [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) of Samos (c. 570 BC - c. 495 BC) and other early Greek philosophers speculated the Earth was not flat because they reasoned it  had a spherical shape.  
         
The idea of a spherical Earth widely remained a matter of speculation until the 3rd century BC, when Hellenistic astronomy established the spherical shape of the Earth as a physical fact and calculated the Earth's circumference.  
         
The paradigm gradually was adopted throughout the Old World during Late Antiquity (c. 280 AD - c. 650 AD) and the Middle Ages (c. 400 AD - c. 1600 AD). In general, Chinese society didn't subscribe to the idea of a spherical Earth until the 17th century.  
         
A practical demonstration of Earth's sphericity was achieved by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano's circumnavigation (20 Sep 1519 – 6 Sep 1522). Their fleet sailed from Spain with 5 ships and between 230 and 270 men, circumnavigated the world, and returned to  Spain nearly 3 years after their departure. When they returned to Spain, only [1 ship and 18 men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan%27s_circumnavigation) were remaining in the fleet.      
       
After Pythagoras and other Greek thinkers reasoned the Earth was spherical, around 2,100 years passed before all  world civilization generally came on board to accept the idea Earth has a spherical shape.  
        
Some people living today and born tomorrow think and will think anthropogenic global warming and climate change are a hoax or not facts until the day they die, including some within  the current average monthly number of [330 million](https://www.redditinc.com/) active Reddit users. However, around the world, most people alive today and born tomorrow already know or will come to know sometime during their early childhoods that anthropogenic global warming and climate change are real like they already know or will come to know the Earth is spherical.

,"\>  Tony does amazing at citing his sources and references.

Right - and you've checked for yourself that what he says about his sources is correct? And you've checked that his math is solid?

I've looked at his work in the past. Back then, I found that he was flatly averaging station data across the US to get the US average. And that is *bad,* like, real bad, mathematically. If you want a spatial average of temperature anomaly across the US, you have to adjust for the spatial area that each station covers, and you also have to baseline the stations so that your anomaly is correct.

Here, let me give an example: say you want to calculate the average anomaly from 1950 to 2019. And say in 1950, you had 100 stations in Florida, and 1 in each other state. And then, by 2020, the distribution of temperature-monitoring stations had shifted, such that you had 100 stations in Montana, and 1 in each other state. As Montana is colder than Florida, if you simply flat-averaged all of the stations together, your result would be incorrectly too warm in 1950, and too cold in 2020. Stations should instead be averaged by how much *area* they cover, and this correctly handles changes in the density of stations in a given area.

And yes, in the real world, in the last \~80 years we've shifted a bunch of temperature stations from the South to the northern US, so this example isn't just made up. It's a real, applicable way you can skew the data if you do the math wrong.

This was one of the mistakes that Heller used to make pretty regularly, and he'd double down on it when challenged. He didn't really care about whether his math was right, so much as whether he could use his results to bludgeon climate science. And boy, was his math wrong.

So that's why I ask if you've *really* checked his math for yourself. If you stand by his work, you'd damn sure better have checked it.",Tony does amazing at citing his sources and references Right and youve checked for yourself that what he says about his sources is correct And youve checked that his math is solid Ive looked at his work in the past Back then I found that he was flatly averaging station data across the US to get the US average And that is bad like real bad mathematically If you want a spatial average of temperature anomaly across the US you have to adjust for the spatial area that each station covers and you also have to baseline the stations so that your anomaly is correct Here let me give an example say you want to calculate the average anomaly from to And say in you had stations in Florida and in each other state And then by the distribution of temperaturemonitoring stations had shifted such that you had stations in Montana and in each other state As Montana is colder than Florida if you simply flataveraged all of the stations together your result would be incorrectly too warm in and too cold in Stations should instead be averaged by how much area they cover and this correctly handles changes in the density of stations in a given area And yes in the real world in the last years weve shifted a bunch of temperature stations from the South to the northern US so this example isnt just made up Its a real applicable way you can skew the data if you do the math wrong This was one of the mistakes that Heller used to make pretty regularly and hed double down on it when challenged He didnt really care about whether his math was right so much as whether he could use his results to bludgeon climate science And boy was his math wrong So thats why I ask if youve really checked his math for yourself If you stand by his work youd damn sure better have checked it,331,wrong like correct flataveraged yes results flatly south make given applicable ask damn much thats give youd better calculate made isnt climate challenged shifted weve anomaly result bunch whether cold also boy spatial pretty adjust references say says checked averaged one use world found way us simply hed could state want stand area sure baseline looked handles would work citing temperature heller skew cover florida science ive past care bad montana regularly right colder data example density really warm stations double correctly average incorrectly sources across amazing years distribution real mathematically northern math youve covers instead solid changes didnt together get back let temperaturemonitoring mistakes bludgeon used averaging station last tony

,"\>  We are talking about the global system.

Right, and globally, the Earth is treated as spherical.

Here's an image of what an actual model grid normally looks like:[https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models)

Importantly, the grid as a whole is still spherical from an ""outer space"" perspective. The planet is round, with half of it being exposed to sunlight at any given time. At the poles, the light still comes in near the horizon. Etc. These are the most important aspects of a round, spherical Earth vs a Flat Earth.

What your paper is talking about is the *local* conditions. Locally, a grid point in the model has a flat top, a flat bottom, and intersects with its neighbors at right angles. This is still something that needs to be fixed, and I appreciate the authors pointing out how this affects things like the absorption of light in the upper atmosphere.

But while this is a valid problem that needs to be worked on, it is definitely *not* the same as ""models treat the Earth as flat"", because that would imply that they treat the Earth as flat in *all* aspects. Like, what you'd imagine when you talk about a Flat Earth. No night or day, no poles, etc. Mathematically and physically, these are two very different things.",We are talking about the global system Right and globally the Earth is treated as spherical Heres an image of what an actual model grid normally looks like Importantly the grid as a whole is still spherical from an outer space perspective The planet is round with half of it being exposed to sunlight at any given time At the poles the light still comes in near the horizon Etc These are the most important aspects of a round spherical Earth vs a Flat Earth What your paper is talking about is the local conditions Locally a grid point in the model has a flat top a flat bottom and intersects with its neighbors at right angles This is still something that needs to be fixed and I appreciate the authors pointing out how this affects things like the absorption of light in the upper atmosphere But while this is a valid problem that needs to be worked on it is definitely not the same as models treat the Earth as flat because that would imply that they treat the Earth as flat in all aspects Like what youd imagine when you talk about a Flat Earth No night or day no poles etc Mathematically and physically these are two very different things,213,like image bottom neighbors atmosphere still near appreciate day given important light authors valid youd model imagine needs paper perspective treat night different physically earth poles treated round half comes pointing time grid space something looks things talk would system locally fixed right conditions importantly normally global worked angles planet talking aspects absorption mathematically flat sunlight etc affects vs actual spherical horizon globally imply heres two intersects upper exposed local definitely outer point whole top problem models

,"Wait, what? I don't think we spent billions on developing climate models. 

Science is a ongoing process. Models - all models - make approximations. It's how you get Newton's Law of Gravity or the Ideal Gas Law; these are also just approximations. We work on improving the approximations over time, so that we can get more accurate results when we need them, but we also still use the faster approximations when we don't need the extra accuracy. (Engineers still use Hooke's Law of Elasticity and Newton's Laws of Motion)

This paper that you cited points out a way in which one approximation used in the models might be improved. It's worth looking into, and probably worth improving, but it would hardly overthrow all of climate science or fundamentally erode the importance of CO2 if we don't. It's just an extra thing to refine. 

This is pretty much how science just works. Compared to how laypeople imagine it, science is both messier under the hood and more robust. Our understanding of the universe is under constant refinement, but the core results rarely change; they often just get more accurate. 

PS - if it matters, I write scientific models for a living, and got my PhD in another hard science field, using models to do research, where we compared the simulations with experimental results to help understand what was going on.",Wait what I dont think we spent billions on developing climate models Science is a ongoing process Models all models make approximations Its how you get Newtons Law of Gravity or the Ideal Gas Law these are also just approximations We work on improving the approximations over time so that we can get more accurate results when we need them but we also still use the faster approximations when we dont need the extra accuracy Engineers still use Hookes Law of Elasticity and Newtons Laws of Motion This paper that you cited points out a way in which one approximation used in the models might be improved Its worth looking into and probably worth improving but it would hardly overthrow all of climate science or fundamentally erode the importance of CO if we dont Its just an extra thing to refine This is pretty much how science just works Compared to how laypeople imagine it science is both messier under the hood and more robust Our understanding of the universe is under constant refinement but the core results rarely change they often just get more accurate PS if it matters I write scientific models for a living and got my PhD in another hard science field using models to do research where we compared the simulations with experimental results to help understand what was going on,226,scientific research process approximation need accuracy results write ongoing still ideal co make laypeople much universe imagine robust climate hard ps dont paper understanding approximations field also laws erode pretty another experimental thing extra developing improved time one use hardly gas rarely way worth think improving help fundamentally would going cited work points probably simulations often phd importance science faster messier refinement looking elasticity using accurate change overthrow compared living gravity spent constant got works understand motion get matters hood engineers hookes might core billions wait used law newtons refine models

,"> [This](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/03/1/l_031_01.html) sudden expansion of species diversity into new ways of life is known as adaptive radiation. One way it occurs is in response to events that free up previously occupied environmental zones and roles, making way for many new species that adapt to these vacant living spaces. The extinction of the dinosaurs was one such major event, eliminating a once-dominant group of competitors while some mammals survived. But the mammals did not simply step into ecological roles vacated by the dinosaurs. It took several million years for the mammals to evolve even moderately large body sizes, and the world they inherited was a different place from the one the dinosaurs had dominated. There were new environmental habitats and new food resources to exploit. By the end of the Cretaceous, flowering plants had become dominant, providing food for burgeoning populations of insects, which in turn became another high-quality food source for the mammals, along with fruits and berries. New kinds of forests appeared, offering novel habitats for what would become tree-dwelling mammals -- primates, which first appeared about 50 million years ago, and eventually, some 45 million years later, upright-walking hominids, including us.

Why don't you tell the dinosaurs that environmental change is good for you. Or why don't you compare the expansion of mammals over 10 million years with the climate changes that occur over hundreds of years now.

,"There are a couple of minor(?) imprecise claims made by this article:

>\[Times of India\] India is the only country among G20 nations which is on track to meet **what it had promised** in 2015 under the Paris Agreement on climate change unlike the top three emitters — China, the US, and the EU.

This is somewhat misleading. There is an important distinction between whether a country is on track to meet its own ""promises"" (e.g., their NDCs), and whether their NDCs are compatible with the 1.5°C or 2°C goal. According to Climate Action Tracker (their cited source on Paris Agreement compatibility):

China is on track to meet its NDC:

>\[CAT\] **China is expected to achieve its 2020 pledge and 2030 NDC targets.** Out of the three NDC targets, emissions expected from the carbon intensity target (emissions/GDP) have also been revised downward by -3 to -8% to 14.1-16.9 GtCO2e/ in 2030 due to new GDP projections in the ongoing global pandemic.

The US is not likely on track to meet its NDC, but it might:

>\[CAT\] The US has initiated the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and, after November 4 2020, will no longer be bound by its NDC. As a result of the pandemic, the CAT estimates that under current policies, the USA may have been able to reach the lower bound of its (already weak) 2025 NDC, i.e. 26% reduction target. The US is very likely to achieve its 2020 targets

The EU is on track to meet its NDC if it follows the lower-bound of CAT projections, and not on track if it follows the upper bound. See EU [country summary.](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu/)

The issue isn't so much that the top three emitters aren't meeting their own goals (NDCs), so much so that their goals themselves are either insufficient or highly insufficient in meeting both the 2°C and 1.5°C global target, as well as the current policy projections. But it's not true that India is the only G20 nation on track to meet its promise (NDCs).

>\[Times of India\]  \[the report\] showed that the other 19 leading and emerging economies were far from achieving **their goals**.

Again, this is misleading statement which makes it sound like the G20 aren't even on track to meet their own NDCs. This is largely inaccurate, rather, *the NDCs themselves* are not sufficient to limit warming to 2°C and 1.5°C. The Times are mistakenly conflating meeting NDCs with meeting the overall temperature goals.

>\[Times of India\] Of course, India is not on track for a 1.5-degree Celsius pathway - a target which gained momentum only in 2018...

This is mostly inaccurate. The Paris Agreement set the 1.5°C target in 2015. This was a strengthening of the 2°C goal set forth in the Copenhagen Accord in 2009 and the Cancun Agreements in 2010. To say that the 1.5°C target only gained momentum in 2018 ignores the emphasis placed on the 1.5°C target in the original Paris Agreement.

It should be noted that despite the inaccuracies, the core headline claim is correct. India is the only G20 country that is on track to achieve an NDC which is rated 2°C compatible by CAT.",There are a couple of minor imprecise claims made by this article Times of India India is the only country among G nations which is on track to meet what it had promised in under the Paris Agreement on climate change unlike the top three emitters China the US and the EU This is somewhat misleading There is an important distinction between whether a country is on track to meet its own promises eg their NDCs and whether their NDCs are compatible with the C or C goal According to Climate Action Tracker their cited source on Paris Agreement compatibility China is on track to meet its NDC CAT China is expected to achieve its pledge and NDC targets Out of the three NDC targets emissions expected from the carbon intensity target emissionsGDP have also been revised downward by to to GtCOe in due to new GDP projections in the ongoing global pandemic The US is not likely on track to meet its NDC but it might CAT The US has initiated the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and after November will no longer be bound by its NDC As a result of the pandemic the CAT estimates that under current policies the USA may have been able to reach the lower bound of its already weak NDC ie reduction target The US is very likely to achieve its targets The EU is on track to meet its NDC if it follows the lowerbound of CAT projections and not on track if it follows the upper bound See EU country summary The issue isnt so much that the top three emitters arent meeting their own goals NDCs so much so that their goals themselves are either insufficient or highly insufficient in meeting both the C and C global target as well as the current policy projections But its not true that India is the only G nation on track to meet its promise NDCs Times of India the report showed that the other leading and emerging economies were far from achieving their goals Again this is misleading statement which makes it sound like the G arent even on track to meet their own NDCs This is largely inaccurate rather the NDCs themselves are not sufficient to limit warming to C and C The Times are mistakenly conflating meeting NDCs with meeting the overall temperature goals Times of India Of course India is not on track for a degree Celsius pathway a target which gained momentum only in This is mostly inaccurate The Paris Agreement set the C target in This was a strengthening of the C goal set forth in the Copenhagen Accord in and the Cancun Agreements in To say that the C target only gained momentum in ignores the emphasis placed on the C target in the original Paris Agreement It should be noted that despite the inaccuracies the core headline claim is correct India is the only G country that is on track to achieve an NDC which is rated C compatible by CAT,509,issue report sound process like conflating correct well targets article inaccurate ongoing see policies eu important much source noted made isnt three ignores climate meeting meet eg sufficient gtcoe gdp result among mistakenly insufficient estimates whether misleading limit also nation even distinction initiated promises say somewhat promise country nations claims weak emerging celsius goals reduction lowerbound compatibility us due achieve usa summary momentum rated paris cited mostly already goal action new temperature largely track couple india g showed set despite promised pandemic times unlike emitters imprecise longer may degree gained inaccuracies withdraw according ndc emissions downward likely original reach c agreement far china november ie either rather economies agreements ndcs accord minor able global change copenhagen leading compatible bound lower emphasis revised cancun strengthening warming claim course true arent headline makes overall cat tracker emissionsgdp pledge forth might core current highly upper follows statement achieving policy projections expected intensity placed target pathway top carbon
,"I spoke on this in the South of 2 Degrees podcast several weeks ago. [South of 2 Degrees](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/south-of-2-degrees/id1510764315).

In 2017 China ranked no. 1 in CO₂ emissions at 9.8Gt yr ⁻ ¹, the US in the number 2 slot at 5.3Gt yr ⁻ ¹ and India in 3rd producing 2.5Gt yr ⁻ ¹. Now in 2018 - the capacity for power generation in India amounted to 344 GW of which coal accounted for 197 GW (57%), hydro 49.8 GW (14%), wind 34.0 GW (10%), gas 24.9 GW (7%), and solar 21.7 GW (6%) with the balance represented by a combination of biomass 8.8 GW (3%) and nuclear 6.8 GW (2%). Further, coal is estimated under the current trajectory to still supply upwards of 50% of the country’s energy needs (which are forecasted to quadruple) by 2047.

A think tank for the Indian government set a target of renewable capacity at 175GW with 160GW of which would come from solar and or wind by 2022. This coupled with expected growth would make India’s energy mix above it’s 40% renewables target under the terms of the Paris Agreement. Further, this would reduce their global emissions by 11%. 

So the real question is can India be more aggressive & what is the right balance. While my opinion is irrelevant, the latest research estimates that India - if they wanted to be truly aggressive - could economically move towards an 80% renewable energy mix.



As for the Paris Accord, you have to be careful as every country sets it’s own targets (NDC’s or Nationally Determined Contributions).

,"> what exactly did he miss because he didn't have the expertise

The previous poster correctly tells you what the geologist missed. Using polynomial fits to a trendline will introduce artifacts. The geologist messed up pretty bad there. I won't speculate about why (like, if he's retired or just rusty with the math), but that paper wouldn't pass a good college math class, much less peer review. 

Ok, so here's what's going on. 

(... i typed this whole thing out, and then realized I don't know how to explain it in a way that won't make people's eyes glaze over)

Uhhh, the long and the short of it is that when you perform a statistical trend line fit, your choice of fitting function carries *your own* assumptions into it. By picking the 6th-order function he did, he did indeed create fake artifacts when calculating the derivative. Those downturns in his green lines aren't really in the data itself, they result from his choice of mathematical model.

There are many, many others ways he could have fit a trend line to this data that wouldn't have created these statistical artifacts. Loess smoothing or running averages or just a simple linear fit all would have been *much* better, and they're standard in the science and engineering fields for good reason. This is the kind of stuff you learn in a college probability class, what tools to use and how you can mess up by picking the wrong tool. 

To see the 2nd derivative, he'd have done better to do a simple 2-step or 3-step finite difference on any of the smoothed trends.

Yeah, this is just bad work. It's mathturbation; the kind of abuse of statistics that lead to that quip about lies and damned lies. 

Source: I've got an undergraduate degree in math, a PhD in a math-heavy hard science field, worked at a national lab, and write scientific models for a living.

What the scientists want is to prevent the start of large scale energy production using trees.

They seem to be in favor of continued use of biomass by-products, from ongoing normal forestry harvests, to produce power. This can be argued being part of the rapid carbon cycle.

However, large scale biomass extraction may indeed cause loss of biodiversity and at least temporarily (on the scale of decades) extra emissions. Also extra CO2 emissions from changed land use is a possibility.

However, science is warning us about a ""crash"", about tipping points which can be crossed, that the changes can gain momentum, they used the word ""unprecedented"".

,"Not at all. Since when did all scientific fields of study have to be defined as binary choices?  Food is either ""nutritious or has zero value,"" medicine either cures you or does nothing, climate change is either going to doom the world or it is a complete hoax?

Have a little room in your world for nuance. Climate Change is real - the world does not have the exact same climate as in 1729.  See, I believe in climate change.  We have warmed.  The actions of humans have affected the climate - caused some warming, maybe even all of the warming.  I'm not convinced that the science shows that humans are 100% the cause.  There seems to be some people are making that claim, while others do not. 

Will increased warming cause more drought?  In some regions, yes. In other regions, no.  Will we have to shift where some of our food is grown? Yes, most likely.  Will billions die of starvation because of claimate change in the next 50 years?  I honestly don't believe that will be the case.

Or, we could look at it this way, even if climate change didn't exist, if we continue to grow in population without figuring out how to grow a LOT more food, we will eventually get to the point where people are starving because we're not able to grow enough.  Is that the cause of extra CO2 in the air?  I'm thinking that is a factor, but not the MAIN factor.  If you need to blame ONLY ONE FACTOR for every thing that is wrong with the world, you're going to miss out on a lot of what is wrong in the world.

So, can we feed 7.5 billion people today? Yep.  Could we feed 7.5 billion people in 20 years time?  Yes, we could.  Can we feed 10 billion people in 20 years time? Not with our current crop yields.  We will have to figure out how to produce enough food over what we're producing now to cover another 2.5 billion mouths.

It is possible to make the soil sequester more and more carbon over time. Grow thicker and thicker. Typically you do this by encouraging biodiversity and avoid to large disturbances. And by allowing dead wood to rot. 

Clear-cutting large areas may cause the soil to instead degrade and emit carbon in the form of methane and CO2.

,"There are too many factors to throw out a number with any ease, especially since I am not a forester.  But I do know it depends on what species of trees, what density of planting and what size of saplings.  If I was to only plant the conifers that are cheapest and most readily available as whips, I could probably plant the entire 20 acres for a little less than $2000.  However, My goal would be to plant a mix of native species that would provide habitat for a variety of wildlife.  Depending on how much money I had at my disposal I would have larger or smaller plantings of native fruits with corresponding larger or smaller clearings and a wider variety of large timber species.  The native fruit species are significantly more expensive.  I would expect them to cost ten or 15 times more per acre, but I'm not sure if they are planted at the same density as the timber species.  It is harder to find information about them.  I hope to get some help from the USDA next summer and make a concrete plan.

By this we mean that scientists often have a tendency to avoid dramatic findings, because drama is associated with emotion, feelings, irrationality, and even femininity, qualities that have traditionally been viewed as at odds with scientific rationality. We have shown that in several domains related to climate change, scientists' estimates of various threats - CO2 emissions, Arctic Sea ice loss, Sea level rise - have tended to be low relative to actual outcomes. Scientists considered such underestimates to be ""conservative"" because they are conservative with respect to the question of when to sound an alarm or how loudly to sound it. (It is of course not conservative when viewed in terms of giving people adequate time to prepare.)

,"Is it possible that the peer review process itself has a conservative bias? That is effectively what the book is arguing.

In the UK we have two parallel legal processes - in the criminal justice system, proof is required ""beyond reasonable doubt"", while in the civil legal system, a lower threshold is required, the ""balance of probability"" 

The high level of consensus required by the ipcc makes it more similar to the criminal justice system - it is extremely reliable (at least this much is certain) and therefore inevitable conservative, because what is likely, but unproven, is excluded.

Obviously the whole area is massively complex, and also politicised, which makes all judgements difficult, but there is very clearly a trend in my observation for significant milestones to ground rush ahead of the most respected scientific opinion.

,"Seems like a cool initiative! 

I'd like to know where they get the 1 trillion metric tons goal from though? 

the IPCC SR1.5 has this to say about soil sequestration:

>At local scales there is robust evidence that Soil Carbon Sequestration (SCS, e.g.,agroforestry,De Stefano and Jacobson,2018), restoration of degraded land (Griscom et al., 2017), or conservation agriculture management practices (Aguilera et al., 2013; Poeplau and Don, 2015; Vicente-Vicente et al., 2016)have co-benefits in agriculture and that many measures are cost-effective even without supportive climate policy. 

Ok, good stuff, seem to be in line so far, now lets look at numbers.

>Evidence at global scale for potentials and especially costs is much lower.

...

>The literature spans cost ranges of –40–100 USDtCO2-1(negative costs relating to the multiple co-benefits of SCS, such as increased productivity and resilience of soils (P. Smith et al., 2014)and 2050 potentials are estimated between 1–11 GtCO2 yr-1, narrowed down to **2–5 GtCO2yr-1** considering that studies above 5 GtCO2 yr-1 often do not apply constraints, while estimates lower than 2 GtCO2yr-1 mostly focus on single practices (Fuss et al., 2018).

Ok, so sequestration possibility of 2-5GtCO2yr. No bad - but wouldn't that take 200-500 years to sequester 1Tt?

>SCS has negligible water and energy requirements (Smith, 2016), affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust evidence)and can be applied without changing current land use thus making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land footprint. **However, soil sinks saturate after 10–100 years, depending on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016)**.

Ouch, so ""best case"" would be ~500Gt over 100 years if all soil could sequester the maximum possible (not at all probable). Taking a mid range of  3.5Gt/yr and saturation period of 50 years gives us only.... 175GtCO2 sequestered. 

In addition, we need to consider the large amounts of fossil fuels used in agriculture - I don't have a number on this at hand, but the emissions related to fertilizer production (Haber-Bosch, phosphorous rock mining), transportation, running (and producing) the farm equipment, etc.

,"I have never heard that plants feed sugars back into the soil from their roots. Plant roots grow in soil and eventually die and decompose back into the soil but l am skeptical that it is a living process. 

I’m not sure either if carbon is taken up by roots yet l am certain that carbon dioxide is absorbed by leaves from the atmosphere where it chemically reacts with water absorbed by the roots from the soil to produce sugar. 

From.   
https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/where_do_trees_get_their_mass_from

The mass of a tree is primarily carbon. The carbon comes from carbon dioxide used during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants convert the sun’s energy into chemical energy which is captured within the bonds of carbon molecules built from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. Yes, the carbon from carbon dioxide in the air we breathe out ends up in “food” molecules (called glucose) each of which contains 6 carbon atoms (and 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms).

I think the benefit of adding forms of carbon to the soil is that it improves aeration and water retention.

,"They don't specifically mention Biochar, however, [Indigo Carbon](https://www.indigoag.com/for-growers/indigo-carbon) seems to be  product that farmers can buy from IndigoAG for their soil. The stated benefits are quite close to my understanding of biochar, so most likely it's a form of biochar or similar.

Edit: And the natural progression would be ""How much would biochar add to soil sequestration"". The answer is... not much:

>Fuss et al. (2018)lower the 2050 range to **0.3–2 GtCO2 yr-1**. This potential is below previous estimates (e.g.,Woolf et al.,2010), which additionally consider the displacement of fossil fuels through biochar. Permanence depends on soil type and biochar production temperatures, varying between a few decades and several centuries (Fang et al., 2014). Costs are 30–120 USD tCO2–1(medium agreement, medium evidence) (McCarl et al., 2009; McGlashan et al., 2012; McLaren, 2012; Smith, 2016).

>However, 40–260 Mha are needed to grow the biomass for biochar for implementation at 0.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1(Smith, 2016), even though it is also possible to use residues (e.g., Windeatt et al.,2014). Biochar is further constrained by the maximum safe holding capacity of soils (Lenton, 2010)and the labile nature of carbon sequestrated in plants and soil at higher temperatures (Wang et al., 2013).

So, over our previously considered 50 yer estimate, Biochar could add a middle estimate of 1.1GtCO2/yr for a total of 55GtCo2 at a land-cost of ~5Bha of land devoted *only* to biochar creation. 

To put that in context, the USA only has ~ [174.5Mha](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Agriculture/Arable-land/Hectares) of arable land. According to [""Our World in Data""](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture) to total global agricultural land area is 4,889 million ha or 4.8Bha and total global land area is ~13Bha . This would mean that, based on the IPCC numbers, it would take 38% of our total global land area (and more than our total current agricultural land area) to produce biomass for biochar - to sequester *only* 1.1GtCO2/yr. This, when one of the primary suggestions by the IPCC is to *decrease* total land-under-agriculture by 25%+ by 2050 in order to facilitate aforestation and reforestation (which are estimated to capture and sequester more CO2/yr than biochar anyways). This does not seem like either a realistic option (logistics alone), not an optimal option for carbon capture and sequestration.  Most likely, biochar will only function to increase agricultural output and assist in creating long-term, sustainable, healthy soil - but will play little to no roll in carbon capture and sequestration.",They dont specifically mention Biochar however Indigo Carbon seems to be product that farmers can buy from IndigoAG for their soil The stated benefits are quite close to my understanding of biochar so most likely its a form of biochar or similar Edit And the natural progression would be How much would biochar add to soil sequestration The answer is not much Fuss et al lower the range to GtCO yr This potential is below previous estimates egWoolf et al which additionally consider the displacement of fossil fuels through biochar Permanence depends on soil type and biochar production temperatures varying between a few decades and several centuries Fang et al Costs are USD tCOmedium agreement medium evidence McCarl et al McGlashan et al McLaren Smith However Mha are needed to grow the biomass for biochar for implementation at GtCOeq yrSmith even though it is also possible to use residues eg Windeatt et al Biochar is further constrained by the maximum safe holding capacity of soils Lenton and the labile nature of carbon sequestrated in plants and soil at higher temperatures Wang et al So over our previously considered yer estimate Biochar could add a middle estimate of GtCOyr for a total of GtCo at a landcost of Bha of land devoted only to biochar creation To put that in context the USA only has Mha of arable land According to Our World in Data to total global agricultural land area is million ha or Bha and total global land area is Bha This would mean that based on the IPCC numbers it would take of our total global land area and more than our total current agricultural land area to produce biomass for biochar to sequester only GtCOyr This when one of the primary suggestions by the IPCC is to decrease total landunderagriculture by by in order to facilitate aforestation and reforestation which are estimated to capture and sequester more COyr than biochar anyways This does not seem like either a realistic option logistics alone not an optimal option for carbon capture and sequestration Most likely biochar will only function to increase agricultural output and assist in creating longterm sustainable healthy soil but will play little to no roll in carbon capture and sequestration,374,plants needed biochar like gtcoyr similar sequestration mccarl anyways nature landcost additionally sequester depends sequestrated million grow increase facilitate natural coyr put much optimal capacity indigo dont biomass eg understanding assist mcglashan production close safe total mean creating estimates temperatures also product take numbers landunderagriculture even residues quite yer logistics yrsmith add previously range stated yr soil one use world based soils creation devoted agricultural usa could however constrained realistic area implementation potential benefits centuries healthy would mention answer option et reforestation ha egwoolf produce specifically play edit longterm estimate context land alone seems according medium form likely smith gtco wang agreement possible data seem either farmers considered though bha ipcc maximum fuels fossil tcomedium global consider order evidence decrease sustainable al permanence higher decades lower type usd little displacement capture middle indigoag varying output fuss windeatt holding roll previous aforestation progression labile gtcoeq mha buy costs primary estimated mclaren current lenton function suggestions several fang carbon arable

Nice, thanks for this – only point I'd make is biochar creation doesn't necessarily need land - it just needs a facility to essentially 'char' whatever material you want to use. That podcast I linked to has a lot of good insight into this -- I loved his idea of using the excess seaweed that hits the beaches (becoming a bigger problem in certain parts of the world) and turning that into bio-char. 

&#x200B;

There's just lots of interesting applications of it – one other I liked is that it speeds up growth for plants/tree's ... so i.e. if you planted tree's and they need 10 years to get to maturity so that they could be capturing the fully estimated amount of c02, adding biochar into the soil would speed up that process by double.",Bha of land devoted only to biochar creation Nice thanks for this only point Id make is biochar creation doesnt necessarily need land it just needs a facility to essentially char whatever material you want to use That podcast I linked to has a lot of good insight into this I loved his idea of using the excess seaweed that hits the beaches becoming a bigger problem in certain parts of the world and turning that into biochar Theres just lots of interesting applications of it one other I liked is that it speeds up growth for plantstrees so ie if you planted trees and they need years to get to maturity so that they could be capturing the fully estimated amount of c adding biochar into the soil would speed up that process by double,136,doesnt nice lots planted linked lot biochar process capturing plantstrees need necessarily trees seaweed speed fully material land beaches make parts liked certain soil one use world turning loved get creation maturity podcast applications id becoming devoted good excess c interesting could char using estimated whatever growth needs ie want bha adding bigger double facility insight thanks hits would point idea theres speeds essentially problem amount years

,"The headline is misleading.

More, the total carbon output will still increase geometrically, absent any other measures.

Your parents went through 9/11, multiple devastating recessions, etc., and *their* parents went through AIDS, the Ozone crisis, etc., and *their* parents went through Vietnam, Love Canal, violent civil rights battles, and that's only halfway through the last century. 

As the Covid crisis reminded us, the world routinely goes through horrific plagues and pandemics. Just a century ago, as World War I was still killing its tens of millions worldwide (when the population was only 1.6 billion), a flu pandemic killed \~50 million people. Routinely, volcano eruptions have darkened the skies for *years* and caused massive famines and starvation, most recently in 1815: [https://courses.bowdoin.edu/history-2203-fall-2020-sboe/your-choosing-i/](https://courses.bowdoin.edu/history-2203-fall-2020-sboe/your-choosing-i/) )

There's *always* something bad going on, always some global crisis. One thing that's different now is we have more ability to limit damage -- while also having more ability to *cause* damage, such as nuclear weapons and burning carbon for industrial society -- so pandemics kill far fewer people, and many new methods are becoming available to lessen and eventually reverse climate change.

If you're passionate about climate change, there are hundreds of interesting and meaningful careers you could have as an adult. Meanwhile, remember that millennials (probably your parents) are an especially gloomy, stressed-out generation. They make everything sound worse than it is, and they are the first generation to have their minds destroyed by late-capitalism social media. You'll probably do much better!

,"Hi! As someone else said, there's no such thing as normal. But, the thing that our previous generations lacked was probably the amount of responsibility and burden placed on the next generation to ""unfuck things"". I mean, yes, a hundred years ago (and well, actually, it's still going on in undeveloped countries), children worked from the age of 2 or 3. However I don't think they were expected to build their worldview of the future or involve themselves in policy as much as young people do now to avoid natural catastrophes.

I'm not going to lie. The next few decades are going to be a bit harsh. I'm only around 15 years older than you and sometimes I am scared. It is normal to be scared given everything that's happening and since we're at a crossroad. But, if there is anything consoling is that we are not alone in climate change, nor are we alone at facing it. There is still some remnant people trying to make money from avoiding the inevitable: that we are undergoing massive changes in our society. It starts slow and then it will be all at once. From EV cars, hopefully more bike-friendly cities, to renewables everywhere to hopefully re-greening our cities and landscapes and consuming much less disposable stuff than we've been using up the past 40 years.

Changes are hard to make and live through, specially when they're made during a crisis. But crisis are great accelerators for change. Some are going to point out that the crisis is due to the necessary changes, but most people are not so easily fooled, we know we're running out of time to flip the switch.

I often have high hope for the future. It is going to suck sometimes in the meantime, but if we push the strings in the right direction - and, with how the climate crisis is built things are meant to go mostly in the right way - then even through the bad times there is a lot of things to enjoy and a lot of things to look forward to. As well as spending time with family and friends.

I remember how, when I was a kid, my parents used to tell me how this and that place used to be a grassfield or how much less urbanized and beautiful X was. In some places, we are going to have to revert urban spread/suburbs and return land back to nature. We are re-learning what was stolen from our parent's generation: that we are not meant to live only with and for our most-inner circle. That we are stronger together as a community. That we are part of nature and the natural world and wildlife is meant to surround us, that we are not ""a thing apart"". That we shouldn't feel alone, looking to the stars for ""life outside earth"", when we are so surrounded by different animal lifetimes and ways of understanding, by this incredibly complex and beautiful system...

We are going to go through a change as big as the Industrial Revolution, but ""in reverse"" in some ways. At that time, children left the countryside and moved to cities, where the air was more polluted, but they often had a chance of an education or of learning a trade.

Nowadays, I expect many more to live in cities, but those cities will have to transform to something more sustainable. Less roads for cars, more bikes and parks and public places for gardening. We will transform green places to sustain more native birds and insects, specially in the suburbs. And when we go across the country, we will see more windmills, and solar panels everywhere, even on farmland. Some will say now that it looks ugly. But those solar panels, contaminate almost nothing compared to our power plants now. They do not pollute your air nor water. They will bring money to farmers, and keep their crops safe from extreme weather. They also are more water efficient for the crops.

We're re-building things to outlive us and to solve many problems at once: to sustain and let humans thrive and to let nature thrive. And that is much more worth than all the ads our parents have grown up with, and that I have seen as normal during our whole childhoods. We are also rewilding and rebuilding ecosystems that our grandparents or great-grandparents lost through overgrazing or hunting. And now with our current experience and knowledge we know how to recover the lost forests, grasslands, etc. I'm really excited to see wild bison like we haven't seen in Europe in a century.

,"What is normal?

I flipped through a book about the most terrible predators humans have driven to extinction. One was a huge hyena like creature. 6 feet across at the shoulders. Just this massive beast that ate people for snacks and our ancestors had to fight those with sticks and rocks. They hunted those to extinction.

I'm reading a book about homesteaders and my grandpa was quoted in it. He spent a winter living alone in a tent in -30 C weather when he was twelve because they hadn't built enough shelter yet to house him. He enjoyed it.

,If you want some sense of normality and sustainability I would recommend looking in to off grid living and permaculture.  Arguably that’s been the norm for ages.  It takes a fair amount of work and education to do it right but the self empowerment and freedom will be worth it depending on how you set yourself up.  It’s worth taking an entrepreneurial path for the sake of being financially secure and self dependant.

,"Well a generation is about 20 years and life has only really been ""good"" after the 2nd world war so say about 80 years give or take. 4 generations. 

Before then there was mass poverty, multiple famines, rampant disease, near constant wars (this being the longest sustained ""peace time"". So you probably are on course for a normal life. Albeit a hotter and wetter one.

Now if you meant a good life, like the last 4 generations, the answer I'd say is maybe. You'll have to make it though, whether that's fair or not, you'll have to graft ro fix the problems of the past. 

Even then you might still struggle but you might give the generations after you a chance at the good life. The real question is will you do that knowing there might not be a reward for you at the end of it? Or will you just cling to the comforts and justify it as being owed because the generations before had it good and continued making things worse because your ""owed"" it.

,"Short answer: no, it isn't

Long answer: The same a generation born in Europe around 1890 (thus coming of age in WWI) or 1925 (the same for WWII) might have asked.

Generally it is impossible to re-live anything that already happened simply because the world always changes. From the relative stability of the Roman empire in 400 AD nothing remained in 500 AD. This came with an unprecedented loss of technology and civilization.

Heraclitus, a philosopher of Ancient Greece, put it this way: ""You never step into the same river twice"", meaning the water is always flowing, and the same water will never come back.",Short answer no it isnt Long answer The same a generation born in Europe around thus coming of age in WWI or the same for WWII might have asked Generally it is impossible to relive anything that already happened simply because the world always changes From the relative stability of the Roman empire in AD nothing remained in AD This came with an unprecedented loss of technology and civilization Heraclitus a philosopher of Ancient Greece put it this way You never step into the same river twice meaning the water is always flowing and the same water will never come back,101,remained meaning long ancient loss always never river anything came born technology nothing happened unprecedented coming generally stability wwii changes europe relive impossible age come thus around generation world back put way roman simply ad might civilization flowing isnt wwi heraclitus philosopher twice asked relative water empire answer greece already step short

But the pessimistic view that human civilization is collapsing or that we're going back to subsistence agriculture is not the consensus.

,"You can absolutely live a normal life like past generations and it is fairly easy to obtain if you are dedicated. I will assume you are American. 

First you have to prioritize your earnings. If you can ensure you have a middle class income, you should have no issues living a normal life. There's many career paths for this so you have options. 

Next you need to control your spending. Focus on avoiding the unnecessary excesses that are sold to you today. People in the 1950s did not (and could not) constantly pay to have food delivered, vacations were cheap and local, houses were smaller, car loans were an average of 36 months. You can have the life of previous generations only if you actually are willing to avoid the temptations modern life has.

Last you need to make smart investments. Put some money into your jobs 401k each month. Don't have a car worth more than 40% of your yearly salary. Get a house that isn't unreasonably priced. 

In some ways your life will be harder than previous generations, but in other ways it will be easier. Overall I would say it is better to be born today than in 1950. Climate change is an issue, but if you are in a first world country it will be more of an annoyance than a crisis.",You can absolutely live a normal life like past generations and it is fairly easy to obtain if you are dedicated I will assume you are American First you have to prioritize your earnings If you can ensure you have a middle class income you should have no issues living a normal life Theres many career paths for this so you have options Next you need to control your spending Focus on avoiding the unnecessary excesses that are sold to you today People in the s did not and could not constantly pay to have food delivered vacations were cheap and local houses were smaller car loans were an average of months You can have the life of previous generations only if you actually are willing to avoid the temptations modern life has Last you need to make smart investments Put some money into your jobs k each month Dont have a car worth more than of your yearly salary Get a house that isnt unreasonably priced In some ways your life will be harder than previous generations but in other ways it will be easier Overall I would say it is better to be born today than in Climate change is an issue but if you are in a first world country it will be more of an annoyance than a crisis,223,issue unreasonably like constantly income yearly need paths money dedicated normal cheap make avoid months put smart better isnt delivered climate pay prioritize earnings dont obtain assume investments jobs ensure theres crisis career people spending control next born say excesses country modern salary world worth could fairly car would willing vacations sold american options easy past annoyance house live smaller many priced avoiding temptations average change houses easier class harder living actually k middle issues loans previous first focus food today get overall generations life local month absolutely last unnecessary ways

,"I normally wouldn't be this direct to someone so young and would encourage you to enjoy the moments you have while they are good moments, rather than imagining a future that no one can predict. For now, things are somewhat ok, especially if youre wealthy enough to post this from your own computer. 

Since you asked a direct question, you deserve a direct answer which is no. No one will ever again be able to live like we are now or have been since we never returned to peacetime and embraced war as a cultural cornerstone and let the pace of war become the pace of everyday life. It should have been obvious that constant and increasing resource extraction would catch up with us, and should be clear af, now, that it already has. 

This doesn't mean you have no future or that your future can't be better than the lives we lead now, it's just going to be different and there will be no internet  (even if the infrastructure survives, where's the power coming from?). You should be learning how to solve problems as a group in school, as well as what is needed to make your own food and how much food can be produced using different methods. 

Your future, for it to be functional, will be community focused and based on sharing what's available. If we survive, it will be by returning to our niche as tribal scavengers. 

This sounds horrible to someone that's grown up with the comforts you have, but, having spent time with people already living the way the rest of us need to be, they are much happier living as humans, together, than we are, living as humans apart. 

The end of this isn't the end of life, it's the beginning of something new. If you work together, it's the start of something better that will be more satisfying and fun than all the toys and comfort your parents and theirs decided they needed to be happy. And are they happy? Do you see your rich friends having happier lives at home? Doesn't it make sense that if money could buy happiness, there would be a point of wealth where people stopped chasing it? 

You will not have the opportunity to live that life and for that you can be grateful to your parents for making that an impossibility. Beyond that, I would ask your parents why and how they're doing everything to give you a better future, which is the standard line. It doesn't make much sense if they're ignoring the reality youre forced to accept and so not preparing you for that life in any way. If they were doing this for your future, wouldn't they be more focused on what your future actually looks like and how best to prepare you for it, ideally by modeling the life youre likely to lead? 

Im just a guy who decided the best way he could be a father was to not be one and to look for ways to prepare your generation to cope with the world you've been handed. Love is the only emotion that's stronger than fear, and in an emergency, everyone is a communist. Dont get caught up on the labels and treat everyone as a decent and equal human being, unless/until they prove themselves as something else but never let that affect your default. If the default can shift from suspicion to compassion, at least half of the climate problem solves itself. 

More than anything, please be hard on your parents when you see them taking more than they need. Whatever resources they use now will not be there when it's your turn and the burning of those resources will also make life more challenging for your generation. It will be the pressure you guys put on your parents for change that will give us any hope of getting there. 

Best of luck in your future in a new world. It may sound like a shit sandwich but it's also the first time in a long time where humanity will be forced to live a different life and it will be on you and your peers what that life looks like, at least socially. No one can make this future work on their own, and you'll have to start from scratch, but that might be the fix to everything. 

Try to remember that all of the crap we think is important can disappear and youre still you. None of this was necessary and we aren't going anywhere that matters. We live in a zoo we built at the cost of the world outside, which is now much harder to survive in than when we left, but the zoo is out of power, food, and staff, and likely to burn down any second. You can stay inside the zoo or you can learn to live outside it without depending on it for your survival. The zoo is not life and does not define you. You belong to the living world because you are alive. The rest of us have lost that connection by surrounding ourselves with non-life, which adds to our sense of self-importance and control, but also makes us lost without our things. 

This world is a crutch built by cowards who are afraid of the dark. Humans are stronger than this and are happier when we have hard times to make the good ones truly precious. We are also social creatures that are happier, healthier, and more resilient in groups. This has all been a terrible mistake that we can stop at any time, but we can't find the courage to accept danger. If you can find that courage, you'll live a rich and happy life no matter where you are or what you have because you'll always have yourself and the people you can trust to enrich your life.

,"Climate change is a real problem facing the world that will make life a lot harder for humanity the longer it carries on. But it won’t end human civilization or the world at large.

You can help by supporting politicians who care about tackling climate change, maybe eat less meat in your daily life, cut down on consumption where you can, and stay aware about what’s happening in the world.

23 years old at the moment, making $28 an hour but I was just told I’m getting a raise to $38 literally this morning, I own a house and a 2017 f150 and soon will be making enough to support a family, currently making enough to support myself

Hard to live that kind of life in any big city though you’re gonna have to find yourself a small town that booming with skilled trade work and get in as young as you can, I know a 20 year old making $38 an hour who never went to college, and another friend of mine my age is making $55 an hour, only went to trade school for a year

Lucky for me I was born in the gold mining capital of North America that also has a huge forestry and my family was heavy into forestry so I did that for a bit but I recently got into mining as it’s better money and hours

Just find a skilled trade you enjoy like electrician(they make crazy money), millwright, mechanic, etc. get your tickets and giver shit

The other route obviously is go to college and get a job in your field but nowadays student loans are so expensive you’ll be paying it off forever

My sister is in school to be a psychiatrist of sorts and by the time she’s 30 she should be making 100,000+ a year which is great money, but she’ll be so far in debt it’ll take years and years to pay off so financially she won’t be doing as well as she should, me on the other hand I should be able to be making 150,000-200,00 a year by 30 with no debt

I know the stigma around blue collar work but the moneys there if you’re smart and the work isn’t bad if you enjoy what you do

,"There is definitely hope. I'm not saying the situation isn't scary, because it is. But it's not an impossible situation. I find that the best way to stay sane is to keep track of the different technologies on the horizon, and their progress. Things like carbon capture, grid energy storage, heat pumps, geothermal, you name it. There is more out there than you probably think. YouTube channels like [Undecided with Matt Ferrell](https://www.youtube.com/c/UndecidedMF), [Just Have a Think](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustHaveaThink), and [Joe Scott](https://www.youtube.com/c/joescott) are great places to start. They are entertaining, and explain things very clearly, including the pros and cons of each. You'll get a sense of what's out there, you may even find something that you'd like to do as a job someday. That could be anywhere from engineering to product management to sales. 

Take a look at what is in the latest climate bill -- [Hank Green on YouTube has a pretty good rundown](https://youtu.be/qw5zzrOpo2s), and it's more promising than people tend to think. 

Keep in mind that every fraction of a degree helps. Ideally we'd stay below 1.5degC warming, and that goal looks impossible at this point. However, 2degC seems possible (if not extremely difficult) and a hell of a lot better than 3degC. 

Definitely vote when you're old enough, and get your friends to vote. In the US at least, young people have absolutely terrible turnout numbers, which is really quite surprising given that this is their future. I am a realist and I know that there are plenty of bad Democrats out there, but we have a two-party system for reasons that are (indirectly) enshrined in our Constitution. So until that changes, if you live in the US, winning the climate battle means voting as many Republicans out of office as possible. It just does.

In terms of living in an eco-friendly way, honestly the best thing you can do is live in an apartment in a city that is close to work, so you can commute via public transit. This will do much more for your carbon footprint than buying an electric car. Suburbs are terrible for the environment. But if you have to live in one, do get an electric car (or a PHEV, which is actually better for the environment if your commute is short) and put solar panels on the roof. Wherever you live, try and get energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Eating vegetarian or vegan helps a whole lot, too (here I am a hypocrite). 

Be careful following others' advice to look into Permaculture. Permaculture has some interesting ideas for a home garden, if you're into that sort of thing. However, it's completely un-mechanizable and will never feed 8 billion people. We do need more sustainable farming practices, but Permaculture is not the answer. Permaculture tends to be based on a lot of economic fallacies, such as the idea that cities are unsustainable or that people can/should literally all become subsistence farmers, and one of its major influencers (Paul Wheaton) is literally an abusive cult leader. So really, be careful. A lot of hippy advice is bad advice.",There is definitely hope Im not saying the situation isnt scary because it is But its not an impossible situation I find that the best way to stay sane is to keep track of the different technologies on the horizon and their progress Things like carbon capture grid energy storage heat pumps geothermal you name it There is more out there than you probably think YouTube channels like Undecided with Matt Ferrell Just Have a Think and Joe Scott are great places to start They are entertaining and explain things very clearly including the pros and cons of each Youll get a sense of whats out there you may even find something that youd like to do as a job someday That could be anywhere from engineering to product management to sales Take a look at what is in the latest climate bill Hank Green on YouTube has a pretty good rundown and its more promising than people tend to think Keep in mind that every fraction of a degree helps Ideally wed stay below degC warming and that goal looks impossible at this point However degC seems possible if not extremely difficult and a hell of a lot better than degC Definitely vote when youre old enough and get your friends to vote In the US at least young people have absolutely terrible turnout numbers which is really quite surprising given that this is their future I am a realist and I know that there are plenty of bad Democrats out there but we have a twoparty system for reasons that are indirectly enshrined in our Constitution So until that changes if you live in the US winning the climate battle means voting as many Republicans out of office as possible It just does In terms of living in an ecofriendly way honestly the best thing you can do is live in an apartment in a city that is close to work so you can commute via public transit This will do much more for your carbon footprint than buying an electric car Suburbs are terrible for the environment But if you have to live in one do get an electric car or a PHEV which is actually better for the environment if your commute is short and put solar panels on the roof Wherever you live try and get energyefficient appliances and lighting Eating vegetarian or vegan helps a whole lot too here I am a hypocrite Be careful following others advice to look into Permaculture Permaculture has some interesting ideas for a home garden if youre into that sort of thing However its completely unmechanizable and will never feed billion people We do need more sustainable farming practices but Permaculture is not the answer Permaculture tends to be based on a lot of economic fallacies such as the idea that cities are unsustainable or that people canshould literally all become subsistence farmers and one of its major influencers Paul Wheaton is literally an abusive cult leader So really be careful A lot of hippy advice is bad advice,511,hippy economic matt lot like feed sort terms footprint careful scary never ferrell vote need sales fraction ideally pros cities become republicans given put much farming best canshould youd better commute isnt tend joe ecofriendly climate try latest honestly clearly roof winning leader rundown wheaton close literally hypocrite different reasons hell product take people numbers pretty even quite home garden helps anywhere eating thing know sane tends influencers technologies surprising solar practices mind difficult energyefficient grid one youre vegan based something way twoparty us extremely good subsistence interesting could bill looks however cult think youtube least things realist environment saying car name suburbs answer idea probably turnout work goal green hope battle system unmechanizable situation track enshrined every heat wed places cons others find energy start indirectly engineering unsustainable may scott bad degree hank old constitution seems future live geothermal someday public democrats great many paul possible city farmers really plenty channels including electric means via apartment degc wherever entertaining advice sense office short completely sustainable progress living actually job promising abusive capture following stay storage pumps warming enough fallacies whats changes billion appliances impossible im horizon lighting vegetarian get terrible voting keep management permaculture panels young look transit buying phev undecided definitely explain major youll point absolutely whole ideas carbon friends

,"These kinds of comments are so dumb and uninformed. Let's set aside for a moment that boomers lived through inflation and unemployment that exceeds what millennials lived through, and jump straight to the fact that boomers and silents founded just about every environmental organization you can think of. Nearly every vegan guru and author that redditors follow in plant based subs were boomers.

Then we get into the fact that [boomers are living more green](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/22/move-over-millennials-boomers-are-uks-greenest-generation) than younger generations precisely because they don't buy, buy, buy.

,"Hi, thanks for writing :). I'm amazed that you were so conscious about it already at 4. For me, even though I was conscious about some of the pollution, it took me some time to feel the amount or relate to it to my personal choices. In a way I think it really hit me this summer. It hit me that, every single part of our culture has some ""destroying"" nature to it. The way our roads are built that don't allow animals to cross or migrate. Even the way our bike pathways are built. I live in a city where I can move everywhere cycling, but after a rainy day I see a bunch of snails on the bike roads and often some of them get crushed under a wheel. I'm a big fan of snails, but I can't feel hurt by every single one of them. Obviously not everything is avoidable, but we can dial back by a lot most of our worst practices and nature will take as much as we let it.

I don't think humans will go completely extinct this century, even though the potential for crushing our civilization is very high and the human cost will still be huge. I think and hope that we will get to a point where natural catastrophes are so overwhelming that we will greatly reduce our fossil fuel emissions and dial back most of our consumerist practices. I also hope that we will try to outweigh negative impacts on the environment. Even in the worst climate scenarios possible and with many species going extinct, there are also many species that with appropriate care (leaving ecosystems untouched or helping them thrive), will survive climate change. Current parents and people under 45 already grew up with the knowledge that we can entirely destroy our planet and ourselves if we keep on. Some have been railed in by the system to forget or disassociate personal choices from this knowledge, but when the crisis gets worse, ignorance and denial can't keep their stronghold forever. The thing that can keep us moving is to actually think of the positive impacts that we can make and not give up hope of reforming ourselves. We can always begin again to make positive changes and once we start doing good things for the climate, by nature of benefits, I hope we will keep doing them by inertia. 

It's great that you're mindful about waste and plastic. I'm also on the boat of that. I've stripped all of my flights (forever unless emergencies arise), even though I live far away from my family. I think the best choice any of us can do is to steer our careers to positive impacts. It might not be the best paying, but if we can still afford a healthy lifestyle, jobs that have positive impacts on both our well-being and the climate are going to be the most interesting in the long-term. Find the intersection between what you're good at, what you like and which sectors are doing good things in your area. I'm graduating early next year and have found a promising field that does not give thousands of hours of my life to big corporate exploiting everything for profit. It is still in its early stages, but it is another tool to reform agriculture towards sustainability and encouraging biodiversity. I have good and bad days with climate depression and anxiety, but, in the end, we only have this life and we can do as much. Enjoy what you can about life and keep worry about the climate as a reminder about what things are worthy of value and your time. 

I'm a semi-broke student with a part-time job and started donating to a conservation group (Mossy Earth) with the money I used to buy dumb things that I didn't need. Every small step counts and the more conscious you are, the more you communicate positively your lifestyle choices to others, the more others will be encouraged to do the same when faced with climate

Having said that, I don't think any of the holy scriptures mention ecology. So the question is, why didn't god provide more of an understandable instruction manual? Well, they do say that God works in mysterious ways. Again, this is God's way of saying ""work it out for yourself"" (e.g., keep burning coal, oil, gas and wood, and  more bad things will happen)

Maybe God could convince people that ecological armageddon is part of his master plan. Which would at least prove that we have a stupid God.

https://www.carbonbrief.org/two-degrees-the-history-of-climate-changes-speed-limit/

Here is a paper from *December 2015*, if you want another reminder of how much our perception has changed.

https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2595 

> The world's governments agreed to limit global mean temperature change to below 2 °C compared with pre-industrial levels in the years following the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen. **This 2 °C warming target is perceived by the public as a universally accepted goal, identified by scientists as a safe limit that avoids dangerous climate change**. This perception is incorrect: no scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the 2 °C target as a safe level of warming, and indeed, this is not a problem that science alone can address. We argue that global temperature is the best climate target quantity, but it is unclear what level can be considered safe. The 2 °C target is useful for anchoring discussions, but has been ineffective in triggering the required emission reductions; debates on considering a lower target are strongly at odds with the current real-world level of action. These debates are moot, however, as the decisions that need to be taken now to limit warming to 1.5 or 2 °C are very similar. We need to agree how to start, not where to end mitigation.

If 1.5°C was identified as the target around 1990, I suppose the chances of meeting it would have been considerably better by now.

,"I want to say one thing, with all due respect, you have a lot of pessimism. First of all, ok yes, 1.5 is a number on everyone's heads. Even I thought it is unachievable. Until now. 

Let me give a few examples. 

Brazil. 

I think this is the MOST crucial factor in the fight against climate change, as Brazil is home to much of the Amazon Rainforest, and unfortunately under Bolsonaro, it hasn't seen good times. I am 1000% sure the new president will be very very climate positive. C'mon, didn't he do the Soy Mortarium, and slash deforestation by >85% (I don't remember the exact figure, but its big!)

&#x200B;

UK

Rishi Sunak

The UK has always been very ambitious in acheiving its climate targets. They barely now use coal, and RS is committed to protecting the environment. C'mon, he put back the ban on fracking. Had he not done that, UK's climatical intergrity would have been shredded. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

India 

Narendra Modi/Hardeep Singh Puri/Jaishankar 

India, home to >1.2 billion people, needs a lot of energy. The last time I checked, 33% of energy used in India comes from renewables, and some states in India are fully green-powered, such as Ladakh. This is a major step, in light that India is a developing country. 

Modi also opened up a massive solar panel project in the south, worth billions of dollars, I am unable to recall the name. 

As I am from New Delhi, pollution in the eyes of a Delhilite has decreased folds since 2010s.

,"Why? It doesn’t say anything more than the other 50 articles I have read over the last 20 years.   We are going to be too late.  That’s what this article says and that’s my firm belief.  The longer we fail to get temps in check the more likely extremely negative feedback loops are likely to happen.  
If ice melts the water temp changes 70x quicker.  If you let permafrost melt biological feedback loops produce much more carbon and methane.  If ocean temps get too warm and too acidic aquatic life starts to fail.  Temps on land get too hot too often you get much more droughts which lead to much higher fire risks which create more CO2.   
And if you let conservatives run government they completely ignore climate risks and go off of what makes their country look strong for the years they are in office but fail several years after they get removed.  
So it is very likely we will hit 2.5 to 3C.  And all of that makes it much more likely we will have to try something extreme.   Sulfur aerosol injection is toxic after 20 years or so.

,"> Exponential change in what exactly? Certainly not in the amount of warming.

But the article you provided is saying exactly that:
> people sometimes think that subsequent emissions will result in ever **slower** temperature increases

So I understand the position I believe you're taking, but it's actually commenting on if emissions are increasing at an exponential rate, we will see faster temperature rise throughout the selected period of measurement.

>for each *500 GtC (1833 bn tons of CO2)* we can expect equilibrium temperature increase by approximately 1°C

Which is what the author is alluding to in the first paragraph when they talk about true statements. 

> Moreover, because of the continuing exponential growth of CO2 emissions the temperature increase will also accelerate.

And a part you left out
> Exactly how quickly the temperature will rise will depend on the actual emissions rate.

And 

 > Such rate of growth means doubling the amount of CO2 emissions every 25 years. After 50, 75 and 100 years emissions become respectively 4 times, 8 times and 16 times larger. During the last 25 years we have emitted as much carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burning as from the beginning of the industrial revolution to the 1980s. More precisely, during 27 years between 1986 and 2012 we have emitted more CO2 than from 1751 to 1985 (CDIAC). Continuation of this trend would mean that between year 2010 and 2050 emissions would triple to a level of 100 bn tons of CO2 per year.

>...If the rate of emissions growth continues unchanged, in each subsequent decade we will dispose into the atmosphere ever increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, moving us ever faster to the right and upwards on the graph in Figure 1.
The key word here is *accelerate*. Meaning it will increase in momentum, the temperature increase will be faster.

,"You’re cherry picking, it also says staying below 3c and even 2.5c is within the realm of possibility. It makes the case that there is still progress at hand.

Quote from the article:
“The demise of 1.5°C does not mean that the fundamental policy implication of the Paris agreement is changed. The world needs to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse-gas levels by massively reducing its emissions and by gaining the ability to reabsorb those emissions that it cannot abate. And doing so more quickly is better. For some, a global temperature target never made sense in the first place. Dr Schrag at Harvard points out that the climate system as a whole mostly operates on a sliding scale, where higher global temperatures bring greater impacts and risks. “1.5°C is not safe and 2.2°C is not the end of the world,” he says.
Scientists do know, though, as the ipcc showed in 2018, that the less the temperature rises, the better. 1.6°C is better than 1.7°C: 1.7°C is better than 1.8°C. As a new mantra has it, “every fraction of a degree matters”. To Dr Schrag, it is never too late. “It is always the case that reducing the severity of climate change is a worthy investment. If we were at four degrees, keeping it from going to six is a noble thing to do.”

It’s like you *want* to believe we can’t achieve meaningful progress on this issue.

,">staying below 3c and even 2.5c is within the realm of possibility. It makes the case that there is still progress at hand.

It was within the realm of possibility to stay below 1.5c as well, but the developed world overwhelmingly continued to choose a high consumption lifestyle.

Consumption is the crux of the issue, and what's happened since the dawn of the industrial revolution is a decrease in poverty and a corresponding increase in consumption.  94% of the world's population of 1 billion in 1800 existed on the equivalent of $2/day, so only 60 million people lived a higher-than-destitution consumption lifestyle, according to the standards of the day.  Today?  The population is around 8 billion, and only 8.6% exist on that $2/day (as of 2018).  91.4% of that 8 billion, which is 7.3 billion, are living a higher-than-destitution lifestyle now.  And every single dollar equivalent spent comes with an environmental price tag that's rarely incorporated into the price.

The best technology will ever be able to do is push the collapse (what the preppers refer to as SHTF) further into the future, if we don't address the human desire to convert money into more stuff.",staying below c and even c is within the realm of possibility It makes the case that there is still progress at hand It was within the realm of possibility to stay below c as well but the developed world overwhelmingly continued to choose a high consumption lifestyle Consumption is the crux of the issue and whats happened since the dawn of the industrial revolution is a decrease in poverty and a corresponding increase in consumption of the worlds population of billion in existed on the equivalent of day so only million people lived a higherthandestitution consumption lifestyle according to the standards of the day Today The population is around billion and only exist on that day as of of that billion which is billion are living a higherthandestitution lifestyle now And every single dollar equivalent spent comes with an environmental price tag thats rarely incorporated into the price The best technology will ever be able to do is push the collapse what the preppers refer to as SHTF further into the future if we dont address the human desire to convert money into more stuff,186,issue ever well money refer still million equivalent increase hand day thats higherthandestitution best preppers single existed developed dont population people lifestyle even technology high staying comes dollar corresponding world address rarely possibility industrial revolution shtf human stuff dawn every convert lived poverty environmental consumption incorporated within future according around push exist c tag able case decrease continued progress living spent happened stay since whats realm billion worlds overwhelmingly today makes standards price collapse crux desire choose

The analogy was telling someone it’s not a problem because it’s happened before, not that humans are a cancer.

>\- Geology is also a science, and more precise and relevant.

So you accept the science of geology. What other science do you not accept besides climate science. And how do you know that it is more precise and relevant?

Climate scientists say you are wrong. And based on the massive improvements made by scientific advancements the evidence shows you are wrong. And based on polls, more and more people are rejecting that statement because they are experiencing extreme weather. The deniers are becoming more and more irrelevant every year.

>\- A warm planet is a happy planet.

How are you measuring the emotions of a planet? But more intense heat waves do not make humans happy or more intense hurricanes do not make humans happy or more intense droughts do not make humans happy or humans losing their property due to rising sea levels do not make humans happy.

>\- It’s easier to grow food with co2 fertilization. Plant food is animal food.

I have never seen a group more concerned about plant life as the denier crowd. You would think they would be more concerned about the welfare of humans since more plants don’t do humans any good. Humans already produce more than enough food to feed the world. The problem is getting the food to the people that need it. And climate change enhances that problem.

>\- Also, everyone will die.

And amazing amount of sensitivity. Recently a couple had their children swept away in a flood. I guess your example of sympathy towards the couple would be to just say “everyone will die”.

Yes everyone dies. But extreme weather kills people sooner than if it had not happened.

>\- But the planet will sustain many more humans as long as politicians don’t get in the way like they are doing in Sri Lanka, Canada, and Netherlands in the name of saving the climate.

Not only was the MWP not a global event, see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1401-2), but some civilizations collapsed during that period so it wasn’t all good times like you assert see [here](https://www.livescience.com/66032-medieval-megadroughts-return-global-warming.html).

>\-Do you want a planet without weather events? Never in history has that occurred.

No it’s not and neither did I say that. You should really work on your reading comprehension.

The last 8k years have had relatively stable heat and weather until mankind started adding massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which is causing more extreme weather. Civilization developed during those 8k years of relatively stable weather and the recent rapid increase in temperature and extreme weather is threatening that development. And adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is something that mankind can modify.

>\-What we can see is less people dying from all weather and climate related deaths ever in the history of mankind, and less absolute poverty.

Less people have been dying from weather and climate related deaths for the last 150 years because of modern medicine and advancements in climatology that has produced projections about severe weather events using climate science and models. But now people all over the world are beginning to be affected by extreme weather. And just because maybe you haven't, doesn't mean there are a lot of people suffering from that weather.

The adverse results of climate change don’t happen over night, it takes time. But it is only going to get worse as the temperature increases as projected by the climate science models. At this point it is possible to make changes that will be somewhat difficult but not disastrous.  But by the time it gets so bad the deniers have to admit it is getting really bad it will be too late to do what’s necessary without drastic changes.

>\-We are on the way to solving those problems and fossil fuels are part of that solution.

Fossil fuels are causing the problems of extreme weather and that is going to get worse. And just like in the past when we discovered something that adversely affected humans, like lead that improved engine efficiency but hurt our health, we have done something about it. But that was before some started questioning the science.

Well it has been changing long before that and everyone agrees. That has nothing to do with the fact that humans have pumped massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and that heats up the planet.

The problem is that more and more extreme weather is causing more and more suffering in more and more places because of fossil fuels. The evidence is overwhelming. If you don’t accept science that’s up to you but it doesn’t change the facts. And it doesn’t change that more and more people are accepting that fact because they are being affected by climate change.

,"\>My question is that give the positive feedback written somewhere else

I have no idea what this means. It doesn't seem like English is your first language, can you explain it a bit better (if you can)? If you mean a positive feedback as in carbon emissions, the Amazon normally burns more than this, and usually it sucks it all back up (pretty much, the amazon is pretty complex). We won't see the amazon as a carbon emitter for a longgggg time.

&#x200B;

\>and also scientists saying that they have under-estimate how fast the planet is warming up

But they haven't, this isn't correct. Look at models for warming projections, they're accurate. Sure ECS is difficult to calculate and we might have underestimated how sensitive the earth is, but even then the earth isn't too sensative during this era ([https://eos.org/research-spotlights/past-climate-sensitivity-not-always-key-to-the-future](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/past-climate-sensitivity-not-always-key-to-the-future)). Plus TCR is entirely more relevant for near term warming. We won't see those high 4-5C numbers before 2100. In fact it'd probably be hard to see even 3C this century assuming we stop before like 2060 or something.

,"\> I thought feedback loops are not previously accounted for, and that they are going to make the situation worse? No? 

If anyone tells you this, they're probably misinformed. While they may not be explicitly stated in the IPCC for example, they're certainly used for the scenarios and the like. Some of them have gotten more severe than thought which is an issue, but again it's more of an ECS issue than anything near term. I've dug into ECS a bit more recently but I can say without a doubt they're certainly accounted for, they just might not have the severity accounted for, if any new studies have popped up about them. I'd recommend taking a look at u/aClimateScientist's profile if you want a deeper dive. They give some good sources and considering they're an actual scientist on the topic I trust them.

&#x200B;

\> How about the Amazon .. isn't the fire going to dump a lot of CO2 in the air? Feedback loop or not.  

Depends on how bad it gets. Normally more area burns but tbf it's still going on and people may continue starting fires. But iirc the Amazon definitely soaks up its emissions from fires so I don't see why that wouldn't be the case here.

,">But if you reverse something that is changing don't you then have to reverse that because it is changing.

This comment is illustrative of deniers confusion and logic. We are not concerned about ""change"" but the impacts of that change.

Currently we are adding CO2 to the atmosphere and this is causing warming. But even if we completely stopped our emissions there would be a period of slow warming due to thermal inertia.

>Two global coupled climate models show that even if the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had been stabilized in the year 2000, we are already committed to further global warming of about another half degree and an additional 320% sea level rise caused by thermal expansion by the end of the 21st century. Projected weakening of the meridional overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean does not lead to a net cooling in Europe. At any given point in time, even if concentrations are stabilized, there is a commitment to future climate changes that will be greater than those we have already observed.

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5716/1769](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5716/1769)

That is to say the oceans have not fully warmed due to the CO2 in the atmosphere now.

If we start drawing down CO2 using carbon sequestering then at some point we would pull enough CO2 out the atmosphere to start cooling but this would likely take us years to decades of sequestering.

At that point we would experiance a slow drop in temperatures until we hit CO2 levels of 270ppm, the preindustrial values. It would still take many decades for global temperatures to return to those values.

That is nowhere remotely close to something we have to worry about at the moment.

Simply slowing emissions is a big enough task let alone begining to reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

It is worth noting for readers, CO2 will naturally drawdown if we completely stopped emitting right now.

,"Video: [https://youtu.be/5HHHN2s9ZCA](https://youtu.be/5HHHN2s9ZCA)

Flue gas is harnessed from the Brevik factory chimney it's between 100 to 165 degrees so we have to cool it down to about 30 degrees. This happens in a direct contact cooler the temperature is reduced and caustic soda is added to remove sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid from the flue gas.

The cooled flue gas then goes to the bottom of an absorber. Here co2 molecules in the flue gas react and bind with the amine liquid inside the absorber to become a rich amine solution.

The rich amine solution is then pumped into a desorber where the mixture is heated to about 120 degrees this breaks the bond between the amine molecule and the co2. This is a very energy intensive process and so we use the residual heat from the factory to produce low-pressure steam to heat the rich amine mixture this is truly unique and has never been tried before.

After processing in the desorber we're left with pure co2 gas which goes on to be compressed and dried in the compression facility the pressure is increased over several stages from one point seven bar to seventy bar. The co2 gas is then cooled again and returns to its liquid state before the pressure is reduced to 16 bar.

co2 transit storage in previck and co2 transport liquid co2 is transported to a transit storage facility and is now ready to be picked up and transported by ship co2 from Brevik is transported to a new transit storage facility in Cole's Ness. The result is that we avoid emitting 55 tons of co2 into the atmosphere per hour this equates to an incredible 400,000 tons per year which is the equivalent of the emissions produced by 180,000 cars in a year

,"Bias can be removed from carbon accounting.

Think of it this way: if every company uses the same methodology (far-fetched scenario) and everyone goes net neutral with GHG sequestration. Then GHG emissions flat-line. This would be the theoretical baseline: best accounting practices, right?

I think so. The question becomes \*who\* counts carbon acceleration? Is *Big Oil,* who contracted *Big Tech* to accelerate oil production... or is it *Big Tech* for offering its services to *Big Oil*?

This is where bias comes in. In the most extreme scenario: *Big Tech* will want to push all the CO2e onto *Big Oil*'s books and vice versa.

I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. What I'm focusing on is Microsoft's carbon acceleration. Bespoke tools for *Big Oil* to accelerate the extraction of fossil fuels. (I've never used the tools so maybe they're hogwash)

If Microsoft want to be a leader in the area they have to engage in a conversation. They have said publicly they want engage the question, but in my case they haven't and I've been pretty fair (All my communications [1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TRFUbfZrnuXJcfn5mbN6Fhkwb-3IL6DIKbdYlE_-mMA/edit?usp=sharing), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UApO08IWih9M4-L0tFpxMmmXnllsc9jEpghJWCHP0rI/edit?usp=sharing), are linked in the article).

,"If both Big Oil and Big Tech both had full-scope net-neutral commitments then it wouldn't matter.  I wouldn't care, let them bicker over who accounts for it.

I think you're conflating *blame* with *who accounts for it*. They are similar but blame can't be quantified.

In some instances, Microsoft is downright misleading. They make the argument they are helping Big Oil companies transition. Even if they exclusively helped in some transition --which they are not-- the large European oil companies do not even have targets that are in line with 2 degrees of warming. (See [May 2020 *Transition Pathway Initiative* report](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/tpi/publications))

They are pushing the accounting to books of companies that plan to fail, lobby governments and gridlock legislation.

The concept of carbon acceleration only makes sense in the context of carbon offsets. Both are flawed concepts and I'm not surprised the concept of acceleration bugs you. But offsets are the concepts Microsoft has used for 8 years and plans to rely on in the future so the counterpoint is fair game.

,"I am German and I am against nuclear power plants in general. BUT: I also say let our remaining (we already closed half of them) nuclear power plants in operation and shut down our lignite (brown coal) power plants FIRST. It is a question of priorities! And I am not even as urgently against our combined heat-power coal plants, like for instance in Mannheim, where we heat the city with the waste heat of the coal power plant, saving fossil oil for that purpose. Those power plants should remain in operation during the winter, even though I think they should also get shut down during summer, when the waste heat is not even needed. But again: Nuclear power might be good or bad, but prolongating operation of power stations that already are running for decades is a totally different question than constructing new ones.

,"Actually burning nuclear waste isn't phantastical, it's a proven thing. The problem with most current reactors is that they run at low temperatures, and get their fissile material purely from U-235, which makes up about 0.7% of uranium. Most of the rest is U-238 which is usually thrown away as nuclear waste.

The idea with new reactors is to use coolant with a better thermal conduction coefficient in order to run the reactor at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures U-238 can be bombarded with protons and be turned into P-239, which is more fissile than U-238. That way you can take old nuclear fuel and extract about 100 times the power, out of it.

It might sound too good to be true, but it's not. The science is solid, and has been demonstrated multiple times. China is even building 3 of these reactors now.",Actually burning nuclear waste isnt phantastical its a proven thing The problem with most current reactors is that they run at low temperatures and get their fissile material purely from U which makes up about of uranium Most of the rest is U which is usually thrown away as nuclear waste The idea with new reactors is to use coolant with a better thermal conduction coefficient in order to run the reactor at higher temperatures At higher temperatures U can be bombarded with protons and be turned into P which is more fissile than U That way you can take old nuclear fuel and extract about times the power out of it It might sound too good to be true but its not The science is solid and has been demonstrated multiple times China is even building of these reactors now,141,higher temperatures turned sound demonstrated multiple fuel phantastical take actually u proven even building science times coolant thing reactors run material solid p thrown reactor coefficient true old extract conduction power use get makes way purely good better might china isnt current low protons bombarded thermal uranium new away burning order rest idea waste nuclear problem fissile usually

,"I was a big fan of the THTR300, but it had technical problems. For instance the graphite balls broke up too often on their way. Simplified version: The reactor resembled a bit of a ""sand glass"", those pritive clocks for cooking eggs. Of course it was not  simple at all, but a very complex system. Unfortunately it failed. But yes, it was a prototype, so I guess the technology could have got improved. Problem is, that we have an urgency NOW and our CO2 reductions are required yesterday, so to say. 

&#x200B;

I am even a bit of a skeptic in the question if we ever will need (or be able for that matter) reducing our CO2 footpring to zero. But global reduction by 50% is an absolute priority and should be taken at almost all costs. 

&#x200B;

Therefore I am for an emergency plan until we reach 50% - then we can take more time, in my point of view. Emergency means many things, from speed limits on the German Autobah - even though it might only reduce our national emissions by maybe 0.5%, but every little bit counts. 

&#x200B;

Also running our nuclear plants until we are down to 50% CO2 emissions. 

&#x200B;

Also I demand taxes for airflight kerosine and so on. 

&#x200B;

Luxemburg has FREE public transport now. I know that in Germany regional trains and busses are subsidized (spelling?), but this could certainly get boosted even more. Also I know that big cities like London have some kind of taxes for cars to  drive to their centers, with the exception or electrical cars, I think. 

&#x200B;

Many tiny things can be done almost instantly, if there is a will and I guess they could instantly add up to 10% CO2 reductions even this year.

,"that is a very good question! From my point of view I see irrational views on all sides. I support the green party in most what they do, but they originated by the anti nuclear movement (including anti nuclear weapons) of the 1970s, so they have to swallow a really bitter pill so to say, to let the remaining nuclear power plants running longer. 

&#x200B;

On the other end of the spectrum there are deniers of climate change like the right wing party AfD. 

&#x200B;

Then there is the classical moderate right party, the CDU / CSU which classically was always PRO nuclear power, but they lost their main state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in elections right after the Fukushima disaster 2011, so chancelor Merkel did a ""salto mortale"" and instantly cancelled her former plans to let the nuclear reactors run ""forever"" (my hyperbole, but that is what I perceived and I was not happy about the oldest reactors running for much longer). 

&#x200B;

The other parties seem to be ambiguous. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, Fukushima is 8 years ago by now and from my viewpoint the reaction of my fellow German citizens was a bit irrational after Fukushima, like a panic attack.

I was much more concerned after Chernobyl 1986 and wished Germans had taken THAT one more seriously than they did. 

&#x200B;

Germany and France are together the heart of the European Union (I claim) and are similar in many ways today, EXCEPT in the stand on nuclear energy. the French are the other extreme, have too many nuclear reactors for my taste, more in relation than any other country. 

&#x200B;

This leads to the strange situation, that during hot summer months, when the French have to reduce their nuclear power not to cook their fish in their rivers, they buy lots of German solar energy, while during winter ,when solar energy is low (even without snowcover) Germany buys lots of French nuclear energy.

,">Thorium was demonstrated to be easily convertible into nuclear weapons.

Has it?  The DoE's experiments with U233 weren't exactly raging successes and the most cited example was pretty clearly a fizzle.  The Indian Pokhran-II test yielded just 0.2kT.  While much is made of protactinium separation allowing isolation of very pure uranium-233, the personnel at Oak Ridge indicate that is a more difficult problem than it appears in an operating power reactor.  Uranium-232 contamination is likely in a U233 bomb, which will advertise to everyone the presence of that bomb.

That all having been said, thermal spectrum MSRs are not the only means of consuming thorium.  Fast reactors can do just as good, if not a better job of using fertile actinides including thorium, for their fuel.  They also sidestep the protactinium problem and maintain very low concentrations of fissile inventory such that they can be considered to run on low enriched, or even natural, uranium.

>Processing Thorium is even more dangerous than uranium because of higher natural radioactivity.

Uranium-238, the most stable of the uranium isotopes, has a half life of 4.4 billion years.  Thorium-232 has a half life of 14 billion years.  Radioactivity is inversely proportionate to half-life, and so uranium is ever so slightly more radioactive than thorium.  But in either case you're talking absolutely minuscule amounts of radioactivity.

,">Thorium was demonstrated to be easily convertible into nuclear weapons.

You can make a nuclear bomb using LFTRs much the same way you can eat 100kg of ghost peppers if you really wanted to.


LFTRs produce Uranium 233 (U233) a weapons grade material poisoned with Uranium 232 (U232) which is a proliferation prophylactic. LFTRs are not designed to be appreciable breeders, they will produce only as much U233 as is required to continue their operation and no more, removing U233 from the equation means the reactor will eventually shut down.

""the proportion of U-232 would be about 0.13% for a commercial power reactor. A year after separation, a weapons worker one meter from a subcritical 5 kg sphere of such U-233 would receive a radiation dose of 43 mSv/hr, compared to 0.003 mSv/hr from plutonium, even less from U-235. Death becomes probable after 72 hours exposure. After ten years this radiation triples.

A resulting weapons would be highly radioactive and therefore dangerous to military workers nearby. The penetrating 2.6 MeV gamma radiation is an easily detected marker revealing the presence of such U-233, possibly even from a satellite.

For personnel safety, any U-233 material operations must be accomplished by remote handling equipment within a radioactively shielded hot cell. This can be designed to make it very hard for any insiders or outsiders to remove material from the hot cell.""

,"I can explain the waste claims.

Only a small portion of nuclear waste is fission products, the broken up atoms that actually fissioned and produced energy.

A bit more is U235 that didn't get fissioned, because fission products that are neutron absorbers built up and stopped the fission reaction. France uses this U235 when it reprocesses its waste, removing the troublesome fission products.

Most of the long-lived radioactive waste is plutonium and other elements heavier than uranium. These are formed when heavy atoms absorb a neutron but don't fission. Some of the plutonium fissions in a conventional reactor, but most is left over. And the bulk of the waste is U238, which is at least 98% of the original fuel. It doesn't fission at all in a conventional reactor. All the other stuff gets mixed in with the U238 and we just discard everything.

Molten salt reactors remove the fission products as they go, so they can burn up all the U235, and more of the plutonium. But the real win is fast reactors, whether molten salt or other types. Conventional reactors slow down the neutrons with water or graphite. Fast reactors don't. The fast neutrons can fission all the plutonium, transuranics, and even the U238. 

That's why we could fuel advanced reactors with nuclear waste. Only about 1% of the waste is fission products; fast reactors can use the rest. Their own waste would be almost entirely fission products, which are relatively short-lived. Encase them in glass and bury them, and they'll be back to the radioactivity of the original uranium ore in about 200 years.",I can explain the waste claims Only a small portion of nuclear waste is fission products the broken up atoms that actually fissioned and produced energy A bit more is U that didnt get fissioned because fission products that are neutron absorbers built up and stopped the fission reaction France uses this U when it reprocesses its waste removing the troublesome fission products Most of the longlived radioactive waste is plutonium and other elements heavier than uranium These are formed when heavy atoms absorb a neutron but dont fission Some of the plutonium fissions in a conventional reactor but most is left over And the bulk of the waste is U which is at least of the original fuel It doesnt fission at all in a conventional reactor All the other stuff gets mixed in with the U and we just discard everything Molten salt reactors remove the fission products as they go so they can burn up all the U and more of the plutonium But the real win is fast reactors whether molten salt or other types Conventional reactors slow down the neutrons with water or graphite Fast reactors dont The fast neutrons can fission all the plutonium transuranics and even the U Thats why we could fuel advanced reactors with nuclear waste Only about of the waste is fission products fast reactors can use the rest Their own waste would be almost entirely fission products which are relatively shortlived Encase them in glass and bury them and theyll be back to the radioactivity of the original uranium ore in about years,264,molten mixed reactors portion everything slow shortlived bit thats advanced troublesome gets products fissioned dont rest bulk graphite glass whether heavy even left fast absorb claims win types reprocesses neutron salt fissions use built plutonium could reaction least uranium radioactivity almost produced would waste go removing doesnt uses stuff formed fuel bury fission u atoms energy france stopped original longlived radioactive broken encase heavier water nuclear years remove real actually conventional transuranics theyll absorbers elements didnt reactor ore small get back discard relatively entirely neutrons explain burn

>This said: what do you mean by ""bombarded with protons""? I think you are actually talking about neutrons, not protons, right?

Oh, yeah, I guess I was talking about neutrons. I think my brain was going to the beta decay that occurs in the process of turning U-238 into U-239 (with a neutron) which undergoes two beta decays which leave additional protons, which turn it into P-239. Anyways, that's beside the point.

Turning U-238 into P-239 is very much proven, because that's how P-239 exists. It isn't found naturally. 

Waste is probably a poor term, because it makes it sound like it's just random elements in the waste. Almost all of it is U-238. Generally most plants get rid of the nuclear fuel once there is about 1% U-235 left, which is the fuel that light water reactors use.

Reactors that can provide more neutrons can turn U-239 into P-239, which can be used in standard reactors. The P-239 decays into U-235, which just helps things. There's no need to extract the ""unburned fuel"" for use in standard reactors if you can increase the amount of P-239 and U-235. 

Typical molten salt reactors don't just burn nuclear waste, that's true. What they do is they have much more neutrons in motion which turns more U-238 into P-239, thereby getting a lot more power out of the same amount of nuclear fuel as a standard reactor would use. However, these still need to be enriched to normal levels to get fission started.

There are, however, breeder reactors in operation that although they use a highly enriched core in order to provide sufficient neutrons, they do turn fuel that is unusable for standard reactors into something that is easy to use. There aren't many of these reactors in operation, but there are some being built. The Russian BN-800 is already in operation, and does produce more fuel than it uses.

Either way, there's definitely potential in newer nuclear plants that should be researched and funded.",This said what do you mean by bombarded with protons I think you are actually talking about neutrons not protons right Oh yeah I guess I was talking about neutrons I think my brain was going to the beta decay that occurs in the process of turning U into U with a neutron which undergoes two beta decays which leave additional protons which turn it into P Anyways thats beside the point Turning U into P is very much proven because thats how P exists It isnt found naturally Waste is probably a poor term because it makes it sound like its just random elements in the waste Almost all of it is U Generally most plants get rid of the nuclear fuel once there is about U left which is the fuel that light water reactors use Reactors that can provide more neutrons can turn U into P which can be used in standard reactors The P decays into U which just helps things Theres no need to extract the unburned fuel for use in standard reactors if you can increase the amount of P and U Typical molten salt reactors dont just burn nuclear waste thats true What they do is they have much more neutrons in motion which turns more U into P thereby getting a lot more power out of the same amount of nuclear fuel as a standard reactor would use However these still need to be enriched to normal levels to get fission started There are however breeder reactors in operation that although they use a highly enriched core in order to provide sufficient neutrons they do turn fuel that is unusable for standard reactors into something that is easy to use There arent many of these reactors in operation but there are some being built The Russian BN is already in operation and does produce more fuel than it uses Either way theres definitely potential in newer nuclear plants that should be researched and funded,332,molten typical plants sound lot process like yeah operation need anyways additional reactors russian generally still term normal increase occurs much undergoes unburned thats light breeder isnt bombarded researched dont sufficient theres mean amount helps left rid started oh extract leave neutron provide use salt built something found way however think things bn potential although beta almost would going probably already waste beside turns newer thereby levels uses fuel fission u proven produce easy enriched getting power right turning turn many either unusable water order nuclear talking standard decays poor said actually guess elements p reactor brain random true funded motion arent makes get two core exists protons highly decay neutrons used definitely point naturally burn

,"Most of what you write is just ordinary ""breeding"", like when neutrons transform U238 into Pu239. This is old stuff - the Hiroshima Bomb worked differently, but the Nagasaki bomb ""fat man"" was totally based on breeding this Plutonium. No need to go into the details here, when a thorium reactor does basically the same - just with the difference that it breeds U234 from Thorium. Different fuel, but similar process. There are even Thorium reactors that are not using molten salt, even though it seems the most promissing new tech. 

&#x200B;

What especially is the very same is the requirement for fuel processing, ""filtering"" the useful isotopes from the decay products, the ""real waste"", if you will. 

&#x200B;

The main difference between molten salt reactors and the classical fuel process with pressurized water reactors for instance is, that the primary system can run almost pressureless and can not suffer the typical core melt, because it already is molten. 

&#x200B;

So something like in Fukushima could not have happened. 

&#x200B;

but there are other issues still. 

&#x200B;

I fail to see how what happened to the irish sea, pollution by ""escaped"" waste products from fuel processing could not happen in a molten salt reactor that is fuel processing all the time. It appears to me that the molten salt is even more vulnerable to some kind of leakages. 

&#x200B;

I am not against this system. I am pro research. But salt is proverbially known to be corrosive and for hot molten salt this is even more true. The prototypes so far had issues with metal build up inside the tubes as far as I know. 

&#x200B;

And I really dislike this ""burning nuclear waste"" mythology, because by the same logic you would claim the very same for classical pressurized reactors.

,"Generally I trust the WHO, but below detectable levels does not mean not existent. I live in south west Germany in a region that was allegedly NOT hard hit by the fallout and still I saw malformed chicken with my very eyes in that year - never before or after 1986. They did not make it into the news, let alone a scientific study. Yes, I know this counts as ""anectodical evidence"" that is of low value to others, because only I know that I did not make this up.

Nevertheless it would be interesting looking up who delivered the data for these WHO claims.

Why do you not comment on that? 

&#x200B;

To Forsmark: This was the first link I found, but I remember a much better one. The question is not what Greenpeace claims about a 2 hour meltdown or whatever.  The question is, that this should never have happened in the first place.   


ALL major nuclear accidents were in some way related to emergency energy generation. Even Chernobyl, which was paradoxically a ""safety test"" for emergency energy generation.   


Fukushima was of course more direct related to that. They had not even enough energy to operate their instruments, so they had no clue what was going on in the reactors. 

  
It appears a bit counter intuitive to me, how they seem not able to get this problem into their grip. Usually one would expect more problems with aged steel pipes or whatever. 

&#x200B;

Under this aspect I find those events in Formark topgrade concerning, that their emergency generation did not work as expected - and this even without any severe cause like a tsunami or stupid operators.

Yet Frances' decline in GHG emissions after adopting nuclear energy is well documented.

""corrosion attack on HASTELLOY® N alloy in molten fluoride salts at temperatures up to 1300°F (704°C), **was less than one mil per year""**

--------------


Please note:

A mil is a measurement that equals one-thousandth of an inch, or 0.001 inch. One mil also equals 0.0254 mm (millimeter). Thus a mil is not the same thickness as a millimeter. The term ""mil"" is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.

**Tellurium and neutron embrittlement and cracking of the Hastelloy-n was mitigated by the addition of a small amount of niobium.**

*(please note this is hosted on moltensalt.org but was a paper from Oakridge National Lab about the MSRE)*

(page 22)

SUMMARY

As a result of these studies, we have found that Hastelloy N exposed
in salt containing metal tellurides such as Li Te and Cr Te undergoes
grain boundary embrittlement like that observed in the MSRE. The
embrittlement is a function of the chemical activity of tellurium
associated with the telluride. The degree of embrittlement can be
reduced by alloying additions to the Hastelloy N. The addition of 1 to
2 at. % Nb significantly reduces embrittlement


...


We have found that if the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in fuel salt is kept
below about 60, embrittlement is essentially prevented when CrTel.266
is used as the source of tellurium.

data shows that niobium improves the resistance of Hastelloy N to irradiation embrittlement

Our findings suggest very strongly that a molten-salt reactor could be constructed of 1 - to 2%-Nb-modified Hastelloy N and operated very satisfactorily at 650°C.

,"**ITER**

ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject, which will be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment. It is an experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor that is being built next to the Cadarache facility in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance, in Provence, southern France.ITER was proposed in 1987 and designed as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, according to the ""ITER Technical Basis,"" published by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 2002. By 2005, the ITER organization abandoned the original meaning of the acronym iter, and instead adopted a new meaning, the Latin word for ""the way.""The ITER thermonuclear fusion reactor has been designed to produce a fusion plasma equivalent to 500 megawatts (MW) of thermal output power for around twenty minutes while 50 megawatts of thermal power are injected into the tokamak, resulting in a ten-fold gain of plasma heating power. 

Thereby the machine aims to demonstrate the principle of producing more thermal power from the fusion process than is used to heat the plasma, something that has not yet been achieved in any fusion reactor.

,"First of all I find your tune condescending, quote ""if..... you would understand.....""  


Secondly your logic is wrong here. No breeder reactor ever (!) was per se limited to a factor of 100%, meaning - quote - ""remove U233 for weapons and you shut the reactor down in the process.""  


This claim just makes no sense. In reality there is always some loss of neutrons, so any process that is by nature limited to 100% would not be sustainable in the first place. The physics must deliver more than 100%, say 130% (as an example) and then you can technically optimize not to lose more than the overflowing 30%, so ultimately you get a factor of at least 100% as you claim. 

&#x200B;

But then again you can optimize a bit more and you get 110% or whatever. 

&#x200B;

Those are intentionally uses simple words without technical terms. 

I know about those issues with danger for the operators who try making nuclear weapons from thorium. And this is reason enough that no country would prefer such a route if they can rather use the classical method of either enrichment of U-235 OR of breeding Pu-239. 

&#x200B;

But who said that nuclear weapons will be limited to countries? We know that a dozen terrorists flew airplanes into buildings on 9/11, so why would they not sacrifice their lives for making nuclear weapons? 

&#x200B;

I do not say how likely this is. I only objected - and still do - that claim, that Thorium is safe in matters of nuclear weapon proliferation. It could be consideres ""safer"" than the classical way, if you accept this compromise in wording.   


Interesting last sentence of yours:   


"" Operation Teapot MET was a mixed core Uranium 233 (Bred from Thorium),  and Plutonium 239 weapon and had such a low yield it was attributable to  it's Plutonium 239 content alone, and was considered a failure.""  


I think this leads to the most likely situation that could arise, if we run like 100 thorium reacors all across the earth: Terrorists could get hands on ""some"" Pu-239, but maybe not enough for a really devasting bomb, so they could get hands on some more U-233 and decide to make some kind of dirty bomb that would not have much higher energy release, but much higher fallout.

-------------------

-------------------

-------------------

I am not making such a claim, only that of all the options on the table enriching U-235, breeding Pu-239 or breeding U-233,  U-233 will be the most expensive, most difficult, and most dangerous.  

-------------------

-------------------

-------------------

**what I said was:**

You can make a nuclear bomb using LFTRs much the same way you can eat 100kg of ghost peppers if you really wanted to.


LFTRs produce Uranium 233 (U233) a weapons grade material poisoned with Uranium 232 (U232) which is a proliferation prophylactic. LFTRs are not designed to be appreciable breeders, they will produce only as much U233 as is required to continue their operation and no more, removing U233 from the equation means the reactor will eventually shut down.


...

Ultimately any fission reactor's neutron flux can convert U238 to Pu239 or Th232 to U233, but the best designs make that incredibly difficult and expensive.

There is no way to prevent a determined government from building a weapons program from a modified power plant. This is why they are inspected by IAEA. IAEA monitoring (or refusal thereof) makes this public knowledge.

,"""LFTR's neutron economy contributes to securing its inventory of nuclear materials. Neutron
absorption by uranium-233 produces about 2.4 neutrons per fission--one to drive a subsequent
fission and another to drive the conversion of Th-232 to U-233 in the blanket molten salt. Taking
into account neutron losses from capture by protactinium and other nuclei, a well-designed LFTR

Again you are comparing apples to oranges. 

Your question is a bit like asking why a 1971 Ford Pinto will explode if you tap the bumper with a hammer, and why driving a M1A2 Abrams would be any safer.

>how can such amounts of radioactivity escape from processing solid fuel?

In Sellafield the solid fuel is chopped up and dissolved in Nitric acid before processing.  They store waste outside in concrete lined ponds which reportedly have cracked open. Other sites claim they eject contaminated waste water into the ocean without distilling it to remove radioactive contaminants.  If this is true I don't know, but it sounds like it is severely underfunded and that it was poorly designed and managed. 

>liquid fuel does not per se appear less ""leakable"".

Molten becomes solid once leaves the reactor and is allowed to cool via convection, the fission products at the end of the process would be encapsulated in glass to render them stable for long term storage.

Because you aren't chopping up solid fuel, and then dissolving it in vats of nitric acid and storing things in open storage ponds with cracking concrete liners and dumping waste water you haven't even bothered to distill in order to remove radioactive waste into the ocean?

Those sound like good starting places to me. 

> Yes, molten salt will turn solid when cooled down, but also salt is solutable in water, right? I see no conclusive answer to my question.

The salt would go into the drain tank if needed until repairs could be enacted.  

In theory we wouldn't be (or at least should not be) building LFTRs in areas that can flood.

The fission products will be separated and encapsulated in glass rendering them stable for long term storage.  The salt is then reused in the reactor, it isn't stored in some storage pond with a cracked concrete liner.

They offer most all the benefits of fusion power, virtually unlimited fuel, impossible to melt down, and thousands of times less transuranic waste.

LFTRs produce thousands of times less transuranic waste (which requires 10,000 year containment), fully 1/3rd of a LFTRs waste stream are components which can be separated and sold to the scientific and medical communities, and are in very high demand. The very small amount of waste they do generate can easily be encapsulated in glass and placed at the bottom of the Marianas Trench where in a few hundred years it returns to the baseline radioactivity from the ore it came from.

LFTRs really do provide most of the benefits of fusion from a technology we proved viable more than 50 years ago.

Supercritical carbon dioxide closed Brayton cycle.  Sandia National Labs is researching and developing a new thermal-to-electic power generation cycle that is far more efficient than traditional steam power cycles.  The working fluid is carbon dioxide instead of water which has been used in steam cycles for over a century.  The power cycle is closed, which means that carbon dioxide is not generated nor released to the atmosphere by the power cycle.  This technology can use any source of heat to operate.",why should I sacrifice an hour or however long this might be minutes seconds Sorry I do not click basically untitled video links If you have not even minute to write why I should watch why should I sacrifice an hour or however long this might be I gave you exactly what you asked for which was Where can I view a prototype From Sandia National Labs youtube channel Sandia National Labs Nuclear Energy Systems Labs Brayton Lab Supercritical carbon dioxide closed Brayton cycle Sandia National Labs is researching and developing a new thermaltoelectic power generation cycle that is far more efficient than traditional steam power cycles The working fluid is carbon dioxide instead of water which has been used in steam cycles for over a century The power cycle is closed which means that carbon dioxide is not generated nor released to the atmosphere by the power cycle This technology can use any source of heat to operate,159,prototype efficient released long systems researching heat sandia even national thermaltoelectic view generated closed instead technology minutes energy sacrifice developing write click video atmosphere minute fluid gave basically power working exactly watch use sorry channel cycle generation traditional labs operate source far might however lab supercritical youtube asked used brayton dioxide new steam cycles water means hour carbon untitled century links seconds nuclear

This is a 1 minute 9 second video.

Alvin Weinberg invented the light water reactors we use today, they were first designed for use in Navy Submarines but when scaled up for power generation he realized we could not guarantee their safety.

He instead pushed for Thorium MSR which ultimately cost him his job.

""Alvin, if you are concerned about the safety of reactors, then I think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy."" -Chet Holifield

The Nixon administration pulled funding for the MSRE and fired Alvin Weinberg (who invented and held the patents for the reactors we use today) from his post as head of Oak ridge National Laboratory, when he refused to sit down and shut up about the safety and economic advantages of Thorium MSR. Alvin believed Thorium MSR was the correct path forward, not the liquid metal fast breeder.

The Nixon administration instead choose to pursue the liquid metal fast breeder a sodium cooled reactor.

Fukushima Daiichi, Chernobyl and three mile island were water moderated reactors.

Pressurized water reactors are kept at over 70 atmospheres of pressure. Think of them like big pressure cookers waiting to explode, because if cooling is lost that is exactly what happens. Water kept at over 300°C flashes to steam and expands by a factor of 1000.  We have to build in so many redundant safety systems to keep the core cool at all costs to avoid an explosion and subsequent melt down.

A LFTR is not kept under pressure, there is nothing to explode.

The worst event that can possibly occur in a LFTR is the contents of the reactor wind up in the drain tank, fission stops, and the contents solidify until repairs to the reactor can be made. Meltdown is impossible as criticality can not be maintained outside of the core.

The basin of the reactor building acts as a catch pan that flows to the drain tank.

Criticality is maintained in the core by graphite moderation.

During normal operation you have a plug of salt that is kept frozen by a fan blowing air over it.

If power is lost, or some accident occurs the freeze plug melts and the contents of the reactor drain to the drain tank.

The drain tank does not have graphite moderators, and as soon as fission stops convection alone is enough to deal with the decay heat of the fission products. The salt solidifies until repairs can be enacted.",But your reasoning seems to ignore everything what actually went wrong in history of nuclear power Fukushima Daiichi Chernobyl and three mile island were water moderated reactors Pressurized water reactors are kept at over atmospheres of pressure Think of them like big pressure cookers waiting to explode because if cooling is lost that is exactly what happens Water kept at over C flashes to steam and expands by a factor of We have to build in so many redundant safety systems to keep the core cool at all costs to avoid an explosion and subsequent melt down A LFTR is not kept under pressure there is nothing to explode The worst event that can possibly occur in a LFTR is the contents of the reactor wind up in the drain tank fission stops and the contents solidify until repairs to the reactor can be made Meltdown is impossible as criticality can not be maintained outside of the core The basin of the reactor building acts as a catch pan that flows to the drain tank Criticality is maintained in the core by graphite moderation During normal operation you have a plug of salt that is kept frozen by a fan blowing air over it If power is lost or some accident occurs the freeze plug melts and the contents of the reactor drain to the drain tank The drain tank does not have graphite moderators and as soon as fission stops convection alone is enough to deal with the decay heat of the fission products The salt solidifies until repairs can be enacted,263,went island wrong systems like operation contents reactors accident solidifies redundant everything normal avoid occurs made three products maintained catch steam wind frozen build graphite kept daiichi drain plug meltdown explode blowing freeze acts salt occur lftr possibly think happens history reasoning melts atmospheres cookers expands melt heat fission repairs soon flashes cooling solidify pressure alone seems power moderators subsequent moderation tank chernobyl ignore many c enacted waiting criticality water nuclear big stops actually pressurized building worst outside cool nothing factor fan enough reactor event pan impossible exactly fukushima explosion lost keep mile costs core convection air safety decay basin moderated deal flows

A light water reactor runs at over 70 atmospheres of pressure, water kept at over 300°C will flash to steam and increase in volume by a factor of 1000.   This is what causes explosions if containment is lost in the pressure vessel.   If the fuel rods are not kept cool they will melt down through the floor of the reactor.  

This is why we need to use engineered safety systems to make sure cooling is maintained and the fuel rods are kept cool to prevent a disaster such as this.

to leave the nuclear business and

00:50

Weinberg was really kind of horrified

that they would have this response to

him because he wasn't questioning the

value or the importance of nuclear
