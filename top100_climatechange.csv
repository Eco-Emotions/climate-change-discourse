Reddit is for the most part not a great place for non-bias sources, as you can probably tell it is VERY bias towards a democrat viewpoint. Which I believe for the most part, is actually very logical. Most of the general viewpoints are realistic and good, but the specific information written in a headline as a hyperbole because of the bias. Imo this is actually pretty good, especially because it's scientifically backed. Because of this it makes people who were on the fence (much like myself and many others I know) about voting much clearer. But because of this going to Reddit for world news (specifically climate change) is the equivalent of using WebMD to diagnose yourself. There is a lot of truth on there, but all you are going to do is make yourself more anxious by looking at it. What I recommend is looking up reputable sources even if a little bias (BBC, IPCC, etc..) if you are really interested. Do what you can to help and vote for who will help the situation but don't let yourself get caught up in the ""mad max in 30 years"" scenario. These scenarios are based on a worst case scenario (and even then its fishy asf) where we don't use technology to help what we have and also assumes we burn the maximum amount of fuels. As the U.S. and other countries make transitions to cleaner energy other developing countries will still be using coal and fuels. It is very likely we will not phase all fuels out in time, but we are also developing technology to help it out. All that's left is for us to vote and stick it to the people who are against green policies. As long as you do what you can rest assured worst case scenarios will be avoided (assuming nothing absolutely crazy irrational happens.) And I'm not saying this to make you complacent, I URGE you to make strides not only to improve yourselves but the world for us and the next generation. Humanity has so much potential, anyone saying it's already lost is lying to themselves. Hopefully I helped someone out with this, I struggled with this for the past 2 or 3 weeks.

As a recap I came to terms with it by realizing that:

A: We aren't in a worst case scenario, and the methane permafrost loop has debunked multiple times and is only accepted by very few scientists. Even if it were it's solvable.

B: As much as people claim bullshit on this statement it's true, as humans we have the ability to adapt to an EXTRAORDINARY amount of circumstances. We can and will adapt. However if we want to live in a future similar to today,  we NEED to take action as soon as humanly possible. Get climate change skeptics and deniers out of office, do what you can yourself to improve your life and make the changes you want to see in the world. Also the more you help YOUR community the better your area will be if worst comes to worst.

C: This is just general life advice but live your best life. You can do so being as green as possible but *live your best life*. Find love. Have children, teach them the importance of life and how to learn from past mistakes. Find something you love and whole heartily enjoy doing. Unless aging is cured or somehow the singularity pops we are all on a limited lifespan. The universe is vast and whether heaven or hell, or nothing at all if you live your best life, you've done everything you can.

Thanks for reading my wall of text, I really hope you strive to be who you want to be and fix the world in the process ( :"
,"climate change isn't just going to pop up and murder people, you're going to have a long period of economic decline where people get really really unhappy and that's probably where you will see the greatest chance to make large gains in the big ideas to combat climate change.

I'll say it again and time will prove me right, reduction is not going to be enough to stop a couple billion people from dying. you need to take active measures which effectively include offsetting the geoengineering of 7.7 billion people living on the planet with some type of geoengineering that helps keep earth's climate in check.

there really isn't a natural solution scenario here, climate is not that stable. Humans developed in a window of an ice age and cooling trend and much of the planet's history is quite the opposite.

So, even the most ardent environmentalist needs to admit that this climate that were all used to is destined to change and essentially murder most of humanity. Sure, maybe it wasn't going to happen for another 10 million years, but that was then and this is now. The natural course has been interrupted and it's going to take an artificial effort to correct it beyond out of just reduction.

Even the natural cycle of 80,000 years of cooling in 20,000 years of warming is not something that humanity would be able to come anywhere near surviving at today's population levels.

If you embrace the idea that we can just reduce and let nature fix things, you're still embracing reduction of human population as one of your primary solutions. since we're going to need technology to keep this planet's climate anywhere near the threshold that humans are used to over the last ten thousand years, I think everyone just needs to get used to the idea that we're going to have to actively tweak the climate well beyond that of what nature would do because at the end of the day nature's big plan is to eventually make humans go extinct.

In the more short-term model the predictions of massive economic decline caused by global climate change as well as billions of people's lives being put at risk is also a good reason to not put all our eggs in the greenhouse gas reduction basket unless of course you're okay with the inevitability of billions of people dying as part of your solution.

We're going to have to actively attack CO2 and methane and pull it out of the atmosphere and perhaps even block solar insolation from adding so much heat to the planet. 

In 50 years or so we're going to be at a catastrophic level of climate change that causes massive economic decline and global instability and almost certainly world war and that's only about 50 years away.

I don't believe even if we met reduction goals tomorrow that we would stop rising temperatures from releasing even more methane over the next few decades and then you're going to have to face that temperature spike and essentially unknown amounts of methane release and damag ecosystems.

The biggest climate threat of CO2 is that it's going to release the methane stores which will have a far more profound and rapid impact than just co2. So, the problem will become exponentially worse and that's why I taking extreme measures is going to become the more and more obvious option.

I'm sorry we're going to have to geoengineer the planet, but technically we already did when we build all these houses and roads and farms. All I'm really saying is you're going to have to geoengineer your geoengineering. 

I've been getting downvoted for like a decade for saying this. Convincing that many people and that many nations to meet reduction goals is probably actually a much more difficult goal than just engineering CO2 and methane and ocean acidification down to levels that we can deal with. And yes, as ridiculous as it sounds blocking out the sun a little bit is going to become a more and more practical idea. it's not nearly as bad as it sounds and volcano is essentially naturally do it all the time, but it clearly still has to be coupled with reduction and that should go without saying if your scientifically minded enough to even understand this post.

I'm disappointed about how many supposed environmentalists and climate change activists don't want to hear anything but reduction and minimalism. to me it seems like you're dragging your feet and risking billions of people's lies. Even back in 1980 you were probably inevitably on this path where you needed technological solutions to manage the climate beyond just reduction, because the world's a big place with a lot of developing nations and they're all going to go through intense periods of pollution. 

We're still barely focused on agricultural pollution and very much obsessed with fossil fuel pollution and that's not really the full spectrum solution that you would need even if bet everything on reduction. You've been able to cut back your meat consumption for decades and have far more impact than buying an electric car or solar panels, but what percentage of progressive liberals have given up meat? You need to listen to the scientists and not just the journalist!

,"Is it unconstitutional to force climate change deniers to live in Florida? We can give them free property. After 30 years they can sell it for a profit if it isn’t part of the country’s biggest sandbar. If they are right, they win. If not... we’ll, you know."
,It's easy...turn off the tv and go outside. Problem solved.
,"Chicken Little syndrome!  The climate of the earth is in constant change no matter what the cause be it volcano, radiation from space, solar fluctuations etc.  There are thousands of things that will kill you that are greater than climate change such as car accidents, burning candles at home, smoking, drugs etc.  Climate change danger from CO2 is much less that most household dangers so you need to get this all in perspective.  Sure we must do things to prevent climate change the best we can but over population of the earth is a much bigger threat to man's existence.  Too much population for us to produce food for!"
,"Since the end of the last ice age sea levels rose by 120 meters and temperatures warmed by a minimum of 4 degrees but maybe as much as 7. We not only survived but civilization as we know it emerged. And that was before we had advanced technology. We will be ok.

The more interesting question is why humans are so prone to millenarian thinking"
,"I have young children and I'm downright terrified by what fucked-up world we're leaving them to deal with. Between climate change itself and the rise of fascism in north America and Europe, I think I should get my kids trained to survive in harsh environments and know how to fend for themselves rather than dream of fun jobs. Politicians of all sides have dropped the ball, the right-wing doesn't give a shit and the left is scared of alienating its base who will anyway lose their jobs to automation. 

Within 30 years our oceans will be devoid of life, the bees will be gone, so will be the birds. Food will become scarce, mass migrations will intensify and it's inevitable widescale conflicts will erupt. I am not optimistic at all."
,"YOU are from a long line of survivors. The best of the best. 

At one point in human history,
A bottleneck of just 1000 left around the Younger Dryas ; a very recent event in evolutionary terms, and unlikely the last. We are all close brothers and sisters. Every race. 

Yes, loads of us are going to die but we need to start thinking beyond ourselves and start thinking about survivors. Communicate with the future."
,"And yet, climate related deaths have plummeted 98% in the last 80 years globally. My recommendation is pay less attention to wild conjecture and more attention to actual, real world evidence."
,"I can't stop crying the past few months.  It's really getting in the way of my activism and music career I plan to use to mitigate this.  My friends and family are worried because I'm in such a race to get good enough to make a difference, I skip meals every day so I can practice and learn more about what we have to do.  My entire life is climate prevention, mostly because of the less than 2 years to prevent runoff thing.  These corporations have INSANE technology now that all our smart devices are connected to the internet, any kind of action that will get this rich people less money will be shot down and the people exterminated by their goons I fear.  Is there any hope?  Carbon capture is what I'm trying to fundraise for, is that a good use of my time in addition to political songs about electing pro-environment leaders?  Also I have autism so I'm having a lot of trouble meeting people that care as much as I do, glad to see that I'm not the only one and the people calling me nuts for believing this are possibly wrong."
,"Basically humanity will survive and adapt. As far as I’m aware the IPCC isn’t projecting billions of deaths from weather disasters. The details can be read below. All of there summaries of the data are presented in a way that isn’t sensationalized and they indicate how confident they are in their predictions. 

News media and to an extent advocacy groups are incentivized to take scenarios that are unlikely and speculate about them wildly. So it’s best for everyone’s mental health to ignore those apocalypse mongers. 

There are all sort of things that can wreck humanity: coronal mass ejections, asteroid events, large volcanic eruptions, etc. Biology misbehaving itself and another pandemic is also a threat. The good news is that climate change isn’t one that is likely to take us by surprise.

What’s also important is that we can’t put all our eggs in one apocalyptic basket. We should still track asteroids and study volcanism. We can upgrade our grid to be more robust again solar events. We need to continue to monitor changes in pathogens and novel diseases in people. Establishing a self sustaining population on Mars seems an eminently reasonable insurance policy. 

We live in an interesting time full of great advancements and unique threats. We happen to live in the most peaceful time in history. We are hardwired to look for threats and the historically visceral (predators, warring tribes, injury, securing food and water) have been replaced (in developed countries and some developing countries) with threats in the abstract. I think the best thing to do psychologically is to circumscribe their magnitude with self-education and an eye toward what we are able to do as individuals. That way we aren’t haunted by fear but empowered with knowledge and prudence.

,"Reformed believer, now skeptic. Here are my reasons for changing my beliefs.

Based on IPCC, non-controversial theory of CC / CAGW. The following 3 points are fundamental to the science, as opposed to melting ice or whatever, which points are evidentiary supports, but not proof of man-created anything or CO2 causing anything, just evidence of likely temp increase.

1. CO2 has been 10 X higher in the past - above 4000ppm without any runaway effects.
2. The correlation between temperature change and CO2 increase (as per Gore’s graph) is real, but the time is backwards. Temp rises about 800 - 1000 years before CO2. This is the most basic principle, in fact, the mean ing of science altogether (except quantum): Cause precedes Effect. Gore’s graph essentially disproves the correct causal flow of CO2 → Temperature Rise. But he didn’t tell his audience that, unfortunately.
3. Warming is asymptotic, according to the theory. (technically logarithmic, but the result is essentially identical and asymptotic is easier to explain). This means that increases in CO2 lead to a maximum limit of temperature change, which most believers in the theory set between 1.5 - 2.5 C. The normal temp range of the planet for the past few million years is about 6C colder to 4 C higher than current, so an increase of 2.5 is non-problematic. However, the theory claims that this warming will now release enormous amounts of methane. Why it didn’t happen with warmer past temperatures has not been properly explained.
4. Bonus - the consensus has been refuted by a group of CC scientists at the IPCC. Search for the report and you will see that the IPCC itself has refuted the so-called consensus."
,"A few years ago the World Health Organization published an estimate that Climate Change currently kills 115,000 people a year.

Compare this with the annual number of deaths caused around the world by car accidents-1.2 million.

A (very) rough estimate of the number of deaths from all causes of death each year would be (1/70)*7.5 Billion=~107 Million.

So your probability of dying today from Climate Change is roughly 1 in a Thousand.

So relax, but definitely stay well away from them cars!

,"I will explain Why human-induced Global Warming or Climate change is impossible or absurd. Doing so even the real ignorant will understand why. I am sure no one can refute it. If anyone refutes this, I will leave the earth.  
  
First of all, do you know how much carbon dioxide makes up in the atmosphere? I have not seen any greenie who know this fact. It makes up just 0.03% or 3/10,000. In other words, it is an amount that is almost non-existent. More importantly, more than 96% of it is a naturally occurring amount. This is not the miss print in that 96 % is correct.  
  
It is common knowledge among the educated people that if carbon dioxide itself does not exist, like oxygen, the earth will perish, but some idiots such as Greenies keep saying it is pollutant.  
  
Earth science has shown that before the advent of humans, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was sometimes many times higher than it is today. So, what it means is that a huge amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in swamps and seas was released for some reason. Why were they released? They were released because of Global Warming. That is, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a result or effect of Global Warming not the cause of it  
  
In the meantime, humans are now emitting the result or effect of Global Warming not the cause of it. Even that amount is the tiny portion of a naturally occurring amount.  
  
In summary, human is emitting the effect of Global Warming not the cause of it. So how can humans induce Global Warming or Climate Change? It is impossible as we are emitting effect not cause.  
  
I proved why human cannot induce Global Warming or Climate Change in such a way that even the most retarded person can understand why. However, there will be definitely idiots who don't understand.  
  
“It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they’ve been fooled” -Mark Twain-"
,"Hey everybody I can prove that man-made climate change does not exist in five minutes. Go out on the Internet and pull up a chart showing atmospheric gases. What you’ll find is a list of nine gases or list of 16 gases. For simplicity sake will use the non-gas charts. Most abundant gas in our atmosphere is nitrogen it makes app 78% of our atmosphere. The next most abundant gas is what all life on earth depends on oxygen it makes up 21% of our atmosphere. So of the nine gas is two of them Make up 99% of the gases in our atmosphere. You only have 1% left and there are 7 different gases in that One percent. The next most abundant gas is called argon and it makes up 93% of that 1%. Then comes that gas that nobody likes CO2 you know the one that all plants cannot survive without. There’s only .07% left of the entire 100% and there are six more gases in that .07%. CO2 makes up half of that or .035%. I’ve read where scientist think that the world produces 600 billion tons of CO2 on its own each year and humans produce 3% of that or 18 billion tons of CO2. So now I’m gonna give you two analogies, you got a football stadium that holds 100,000 people in it and each person represents a gas in our atmosphere. 78,000 would be nitrogen 21,000 would be oxygen 930 would be argon and 35 would be CO2 and man makes 3% of 35 which is one. The other analogy would be 100,000 M&Ms in a 3‘ x 3‘ x 3‘ area 78,000 would be nitrogen 21,000 would be oxygen 930 would be argon and 35 would be CO2 and man would make one more CO2 Eminem.

,"Hi there!

Really, you shouldn’t worry. The Earth’s global temperature has ever so slightly increase, and this “climate apocalypse“ many people say will happen might never happen. In fact, the EU is now working hard to reduce its carbon emissions by… I don’t know the numbers, but I went on their website, and they plan to reduce carbon emissions. Plus, with new ways arising to counter the problem, such as artificial meat that tastes just the same made with cells of the animal, and most of the scientists working hard on solving climate change, and also Bill Gates, the leader of the battle against climate change, the Earth may never see an apocalypse as described by everyone these days. So, it may never affect you."

,"Climate is basically defined by trends across 30 year periods (as few as 10 in some instances). In terms of things that can kill you, natural disasters, specifically weather events and wildlife’s are things that come to mind. You cannot and should not attribute any individual weather event or fire to climate change. What predicts getting killed by such an event is poverty. If you live in Haiti then you simply won’t fair well if a hurricane hits you, if you live in Florida then you live in a place with the infrastructure and means to get to safety. In terms of roasting alive my understanding of the trends in global temperatures is that highest highs aren’t increasing but the lowest lows are, so as of now the climate has been trending toward being more mild, where the difference between the highest high and lowest lows are less not more. 

The sea is rising, and has been for the last century (well actually since the end of the last ice age), at something like 2-4 mm a year. So it’s not something that is happening all at once. 

The economy globally is not projected to collapse, crops are unlikely to fail. 

That being said, the debate lies on how much we need to reduce emissions while not crippling the development of the poorest countries because poverty is the biggest thing that puts people at risk. 

It’s a big problem but you can’t lose sight of other problems we need to prepare for, but please don’t panic. News articles are designed to get attention, there really isn’t any incentive to tell you good news, is there?

Now there are these theoretical events where the ocean currents shut down or a rapid feedback loop occurs quickly but I’m not aware of any “Day after Tomorrow” scenario that is thought to likely by any measure. 

I wish you the best."

Leaked Draft IPCC Report Warns Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Must Peak in Four Years



https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58982445.amp

COP26: Document leak reveals nations lobbying to change key climate report


In 2009 it was estimated that we could pump 560 gigatons into the atmosphere before we cause a irreversible 2.0°C meltdown.

We have since pumped out 416 gigatons.
We essentially have 4 years of that budget left worth of hydrocarbons we can pump out.

The problem is we litteraly need to electrify everything and put out 3x our current peak supply of 19 TWatts in order to stave off complete collapse and do it in 4 years.

Thats sinply not going to happen.
Notice i didn't say not possible...its just not going to happen.

For the same reason as the effects of climate change are way worse than even the IPCC is openly admitting; while they are still trying to down play it."

,"Climate change is a major threat to human health and well-being. It can cause extreme weather events that can lead to displacement, injury, and loss of life. Climate change can also increase the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and Zika virus, create food insecurity and malnutrition, and impair mental health.  
The good news is that we can take action to reduce our emissions and help protect people from the impacts of climate change. We need to work together to make sure that everyone has access to information about the risks posed by climate change, and we must ensure that everyone has a voice in decisions that will affect their lives."

,"What we will see first is food shortages and price hikes due to floods and or drought wiping out crops. Then economic issues with the cost of things. Pollution being of concern we will see major health problems as politicians ignore the impacts of pollution in favor of the economy. Farming has already changed due to climate change. Because of acid rain farmers have to use anti-fungal applications on crops, acid rain makes the soil more acidic and acid soil causes fungus to thrive. Our ecosystem requires a delicate balance. Nutrients are not in the food as they should be due to many imbalances and toxins. Some toxins block the absorption of nutrients. BPA blocks vitamin D from being absorbed.  It's not just fossil fuels driving climate change, it's everything we are doing that is unnatural. More than likely you will suffer a long excruciating disease or many ailments as cancer kicks in long before climate change causes mass extinction.  Your house could float away in a flood. Most of us will become ill while some will also be displaced. The places that will become inhabitable or risky due to climate change will see people moving to safer areas. The safer areas will become overpopulated and crime will soar in those areas as the economic impact of climate change creates more desperation."

,">It is not science fiction; it is based on current projections by climatologists and environmental scientists. Many now believe that civilization may have doomed itself to a warming trend that could fundamentally affect the life process from microbes to man. Worse yet, global warming could lead to thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of land ice in the polar regions. Climatologists now predict a rise of up to 1.5 meters (about five feet) in sea level by the year 2050. That could devastate coastal areas where half of the world's population resides, resulting in massive loss of property. Washington Post. 1988"
,How would you say we adapt to climate change
,"Have you considered that before man ever had a measurable effect on the climate, sometimes is changed drastically through natural cycles. Sometimes those changes were absolutely catastrophic and absolutely did kill indiscriminately.  Solving, or even reversing, climate change is 0% effective against being at the mercy of nature. It's the only actual solid data we have on the climate.....it changes. It always has. Drastic extinction events are to be expected. A lack of the would be a drastic deviation from the normal behavior of the climate. Am I afraid climate change can kill me? Yes. Do I think I'm in any worse danger of that with out without man made contribution? No."
,"Wow, this is some good stuff. I've been having fits lately, I read that Wasteland By Wednesday book, and now seeing many of the projections starting to come true on the news has been scaring the hell out of me.

All us regular people can do everything right to fix the planet so it doesn't kill us off, but if those in power keep screwing us over and causing 95% of the pollution and damage and refuse to stop, there is no way around this.

,"Improper or lack of waste management is one of the major reasons for pollution and is also contributing to global warming. There is a need for proper waste collection and disposal system in the rural and neglected areas.  
A continent of over 1.3 billion people, most countries in Africa lack proper waste management systems. As per a 2018 report published by the United Nations Environment Program, the total waste generated in Africa was 125 million tons in 2012, which is expected to double by 2025. The total waste collection rate is 55% out of which almost 90% is disposed of at uncontrolled dumpsites and landfills where there are also recorded instances of open burning. The sub-Saharan region is home to some of the largest dumpsites in the world. Out of the total waste generated, almost 13% is plastic and 57% is organic waste. Almost 80% of the waste generated in this region is recyclable and currently only 4% is being recycled.  
The project proposes to start small waste collection centers in backward and rural areas where there is little or no waste collection system.  
Proper waste disposal means no garbage being exposed to the environment. No direct sunlight exposure to the plastic means no harmful gases are being released to the environment.   
We are raising funds to start these centres in Africa. Please join our campaign at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tackling-climate-change#/"

* Arctic methane ""bomb""
* Phytoplankton extinction
* Ecosystem collapse (particularly from the ""insect apocalypse"")
* Agricultural failure and famine
* Worst case warming scenarios (4 C+)
* Sea level rise
* Intensification of extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, heatwaves etc)
* Ocean acidification
* Collapse of the [AMOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation)
* ""Masked"" warming from global dimming
* IPCC reports being ""too conservative""

,"For some reason, most of our brains can't comprehend stuff that happens slowly like climate change ... probably a flaw that ends this civilization... maybe in ten-thousand years or 10 times that... when we get our next chance, things will work out better."
,CO2 is about 450 PPM (Parts per Million) of our atmosphere. Seems like a lot doesn't it? Until you dig a bit deeper. When you do that math it turns out that 450 PPM is 4.5/100ths of 1% of our air. Way less than 1%. Does it really make any sense that an increase in this very small amount of CO2 can cause drastic climate changes?  Plants need about 250 PPM of CO2 to survive and grow. If it was possible to reduce CO2 below this amount the plants would all die. If they die then we all die. Be careful what you believe and what you wish for.
,"Trump defunded the EPA and Australia and Germany are coal powered, I'm still scared shitless.

,"The couple of billion people dying will be because of the governments reactions to climate change. Not because of it.  In more normal times higher global temperatures were referred to as ""Climate Optima"". The fact is that we are totally reliant on fossil fuels and a rapid move away from them will lead to utter chaos. In fact the Biden administration's decision are already bearing fruit - the diesel shortage is a massive looming problem. Global temperatures are increasing by only 0.1 degrees per decade. Unnoticeable for most.  There have been no increases in storms or droughts - though there is always somewhere in the world having these for those wishing to bathe in their confirmation bias. The climate cultists of today seem very reminiscent of those in charge of Cambodia in the 1970s.  Their centrally planned net zero madness will result in the deaths of billions of people."

,"I do believe the 400ppm instead of the 200ppm of CO2 that we ""enjoy"" nowadays actually makes it harder to jog or do physical activity outside. I understand the body expires/exhales CO2 when exerting/doing athletic things, so it's only natural to presume there is a slight difficulty in rapid respiration due to the air having twice as much CO2 in it as it used to."

,"IPCC AR5 said this in section 5.7 for a global estimate.

>Global mean losses could be 1 to 5% of GDP for 4°C of warming.

At the high end estimate of 5%... that is on par with the annual cost of global metal corrosion, which is just another minor fixed cost in the global economy. Also, that is at 4C, which is not even in the realm of possibility anymore if the new estimates of 1.5 - 3.5 C is right.

For a US focused national assessment...

The national climate assessment, that the fake news was flipping out over a few months ago, showed a cost of 10% of GDP by 2100... which is a tiny 0.11% compounding cost per year (ie APR). About as much as road salt costs every year. ~ 2.2 billion per year."

,"I'm sorry to hear that you feel like that. It's great that there are people like you that care so much about the wellbeing of our planet. When I was of school age I felt the exact same way as you, and what was worse was that back then people weren't even talking much about climate change in everyday life despite the science being clear.

Considering that the public awareness is now greater than ever, I think the next decade could very well represent a turning point whereby our governments finally accept the urgency of the global climate situation. If we are to achieve this we must stay positive and not fall into despair.

Ultimately no one can say for sure how things are going to play out over the course of your lifetime. We may end up doing just fine, or things could be worse than we expected. Young people that grew up during the Cold War era felt a similar sense of dread that you and many others do today. There's also the possibility we may die young anyway from causes unrelated to climate change, so there's no point in giving up if you're worried that you might not live a full life. If you're really concerned, the best you can do is fight to make the world a better place.

Is your school participating in the Friday climate strikes? If not, you could do something about that :)"
,"The best way is to get involved and talk about it. Explain your fears to others in a calm and subtle way and ask them if they’d like to be involved too.

>97% of scientists think that humans are 50% or more of the cause of climate change, **a modest 0.8 degrees since 1880.**

Nonsense

>• The likely range of the human contribution to the global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2010 is 1.1° to 1.4°F (0.6° to 0.8°C), and the central estimate of the observed warming of 1.2°F (0.65°C) lies within this range (high confidence). This translates to a likely human contribution of 92%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 change. The likely contributions of natural forcing and internal variability to global temperature change over that period are minor (high confidence). (Ch. 3; Fig. ES.2)  
[https://science2017.globalchange.gov/downloads/CSSR2017\_FullReport.pdf](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/downloads/CSSR2017_FullReport.pdf)

And as for the temperature it is currently

>Global temperatures in 2018 were 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.83 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1951 to 1980 mean, according to scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. Globally, 2018's temperatures rank behind those of 2016, 2017 and 2015. The past five years are, collectively, the warmest years in the modern record.

[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/2018-fourth-warmest-year-in-continued-warming-trend-according-to-nasa-noaa](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/2018-fourth-warmest-year-in-continued-warming-trend-according-to-nasa-noaa)

So it is 0.8C warmer than the 1950-1980 average not 0.8C warmer than 1880.

I suggest you stick to articles written by people who know what they are talking about rather than drivel manufactured by someone who has no apparent background in any physical science.

This article is just junk.

>Warmer temperatures in the 1200s were a boon to the global economy.

Sorry but what? Where is the evidence for globally warmer temperatures during that period and where is the evidence for any impact on the then economy. And finally what does this have to do with our climate currently headed towards 2C above preidunstrial temperature with a high chance of exceeding this.

More made up nonsense from your self publicising source."

That's incorrect. The fact is that there is a great deal of debate about climate sensitivity.

There are many scientists saying ""Climate change can be slowed and reversed"" then there are some who say ""If we don't get our shit together we risk collapse"". I have yet to see anyone reputable or with full science say that in 10-20 years we will be extinct. Imo those who fantasize about the end of times happen to be the most ignorant, believing their opinion greater than others, the difference is that there's some proof showing that it will effect us devastatingly, but even the guy who said we had a  50/50 chance we go extinct before the end of the century said its actually unlikely we go extinct. Climate change wasn't even his #1 issue in fact it was AI technology.

Cole's notes is: humans will improvise, adapt, and overcome. The great barrier reef is fucked. Many various species will go extinct. Bees are in some peril. Humans are not in peril. Global warming is bad, but two cities in Japan were literally nuked, and they improvised, adapted, and overcame. They are thriving now. Experiencing global warming in your city is way less dramatic than being nuked."

,"ALL  life?  I think not. There are ALREADY extremophile organisms that live in conditions we would consider intolerable, eg. those guys who live next to thermal airvents at the bottom of the sea, and those guys that can live in space.

So, even if we flip over to near-Venus conditions, out of the wide range of life still extant, some of those little fellas should  survive. Cold comfort to  us and our mammalian crew, however."

Claiming that the climate is not in a catastrophic state doesn’t mean that somebody doesn’t believe that mitigation efforts shouldn’t be made. In fact most scientists that are claiming that the politicians who use climate change as a method of scaring people into voting for them also believe that humans must adapt in order to prevent any runaway events. The politicians think they have the answers, almost scientists think that humans are capable of adapting and surviving and that those politicians are being dishonest (shocking I know). Humans biggest asset has always been our ability to adapt and survive since before the day of the Neanderthals. Change is one thing, I agree humans are causing climate change. I disagree that we’re anywhere near a catastrophic regarding the worlds climate. Perhaps if we don’t adapt or innovate and keep doing things how we do now then in 1,000 or so years we may have trouble. 1.5 degrees in 100 years is not alarming."

,"Here's the thing, the world adapts, and so do humans and technology. That's part of evolution, and natural selection. There is technology today that make things possible, that were not 20 years ago. Increasing efficiency in agriculture for example, that 20 years ago, people thought it was going to be a lot worse, but we adapted.

I've been through this before, and have studied the history of this, going back decades. Here are just a few failed doomsday climate predictions. AOCs 12 years to the world ends, is just the same nonsense.

I used to buy into this, but as I get older, and see the same groups saying if we don't act now the sky falls, it's nothing but chicken littles. Then you really have to do the research to find out who benefits from all of this, and you will see how high this actually goes. It's about control.

The 2005 UNEP predictions claimed that, by 2010, some 50 million “climate refugees” would be frantically fleeing from the Caribbean and low-lying Pacific islands. None of it occurred.

The UN climate science panel also said in 2007 Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 or sooner. And then quickly removed it from the report after it was determined that no science at all went into the prediction.

The 2003 Pentagon document, entitled An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security, stated that polar ice all gone, parts of California under water, parts of Europe underwater. Another lie from climate scientists.

Global cooling “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but 11 degrees colder by the year 2000,” claimed ecology professor Kenneth E.F. Watt at the University of California in 1970.

“By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people,” because of a global ice age said Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich."

,"Well if by natural you mean a transition the climate has made multiple times in the past then yes. The earth has experienced global changes in temperature both warmer and cooler. Those changes at time have been many more degrees of change than what are talked about in climate models. So I'm pretty confident in saying that the possibility of this naturally occurring is 100%. Whether this particular period of change is a natural one is a different question. I have no doubts that operating engines worldwide that work off of igniting flames has some effect on the overall temperature. 

What's important to understand here is, global climate change is a reoccurring phenomenon on this planet. Most of all the tumultuous changes have happened with no human impact. Therefor, it is idiotic to approach analyzing changes occurring now as though there's only human influence driving it."

You can play Russian Roulette. You have a 5/6 chance of being OK... that the chamber is empty. Those are good odds! However, I would never be dumb enough to play Russian Roulette as the outcome 1/6th of the time is horrendous.

And I'd say the Earth right now has worse odds than 1/6th. A bad outcome is already a pretty high chance for life on Earth even if we start fighting climate change now with full force.

In fact these are hopeful and provide many solutions in which we can implement them, and if the U.S. gets a good democratic leader in office next primary all that will be left is to start phasing stuff out by 2030. China has already begun to do a lot of this and they are BY FAR the biggest emitters of CO2. "
,"All these say the same thing. Literally they're about 1 UK minister. You can't provide 4 sources that all essentially say the exact same thing.

But lets take into account what Guterres says because hes right that it is vital that we do something and it is up to the leaders to make this change. And btw these ""2 year"" and ""12 year"" spans aren't exact, one or 2 years off of this isn't devastating, it's definitely not good but it's won't change a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. 

&#x200B;

BUT yet again, none of this says we will be extinct by halfway through the century. It will affect billions in our worst case scenario and likely change the landscape and ecosystems of the world, but it won't drive us close to extinction. *Maybe* we will see effects to civilization in the grand scheme of things (definitely directly in terms of coastal communities) but not extinction.

Still I admire how much you care and read your other posts. I used to feel similarly, BUT this is a very doable process, we just have to get the right people in charge and make sure we do the right thing ourselves.

,"Guterres is saying that the legislation we need to shift towards a trend of rapid decarbonisation needs to be in place by 2020 in order for countries to meet their Paris Agreement targets. Not that ""runaway climate change"" (which is a term used very loosely here) is going to suddenly kick-start in 2020. He's right in saying we need to act now, because our chances of staying below 2 C decrease the longer we delay action."

Most realistic estimates these days, if our current policies stagnate state we could see 3C of warming by 2100. It's not great and it will cause problems for the world but most people will survive and thrive. Even in the very hottest simulations (way more than 3C) the panels STILL think the average human's quality of life will improve. 

Now look at all of the insane amount of technological advancement going on right now. Hundreds of thousands to millions of people work on the science and technology of combatting climate change as their day jobs. The do this every day of their lives. We will not stagnate. We will slow warming and I also believe that carbon capture technologies/techniques are going to explode. We will likely even be able to REVERSE CO2 rise.

Cooling is the larger threat.  Lost crops are a disaster.

Your listed facts are not correct.  Many more California fires in the early nineteen hundreds.  Number and strength of hurricanes have been at historic lows.  They are more costly, but that is because we build cities on the shores.  Kelp and coral issues are pollution issues.

,"Can you please share your sources on hurricane statistics and sun’s impact on climate?

To respond to a couple of your points:
Here is a handy video showing wildfires since 1900: https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/05/video-100-years-of-california-wildfires-in-2-minutes/

You will notice there are zero that are as large as the ones in recent years, and far more happening now.

Regarding the polar vortex- extreme weather events are actually a result of average global temperature rise. Temperatures don’t go up uniformly across the world. Some places get colder. Most get warmer. Hence average global temperature.

As for kelp and coral, I work with an organization that is helping restore both. How are they doing it? By bringing up cold water from the deep parts of the ocean to cool the surrounding water. Guess what? It’s working. Meaning heat is a huge factor in the die off.

It is true that there are natural fluctuations in climate, and within that range, warmer is better. However, we are heading for average temperatures that are equivalent to previous mass extinction events that occurred long before humans existed.

One other question - why is it so hard to believe in the greenhouse effect? We have literal greenhouses that do exactly what’s happening to our climate. On a sunny day, is it hotter outside or inside the space that is trapping the incoming energy from the sun?

And your point about it being possible to control pollution is absolutely correct. We need to stop both plastic pollution and air pollution from fossil fuels. That pollution is what is having such a severe impact on the climate.

Also, side note: How were medieval times prosperous?"

Additionally, there are many respected scientists who see problems with the science. Judith Curry is one such scientist, but there are many others. And typically their work is dismissed with ad hominem attacks, not scientific rebuttals.

The environmental movement’s religious fervor and repeated false doomsday predictions have done a lot of damage to its credibility.

,"OK, let's tease this apart: ""imminent catastrophe for decades"". First, if I say, ""You're going to crash into that wall in 50 yards?"" You're going to say, ""Ah, I've gone 49 yards without hitting a wall. I'm doing fine and your theory of an imminent crash is bunk!"" Second, the super big catastrophe is not imminent: It's many decades out. But: We have to start working on it now because it's a cumulative problem. If your car has shit for brakes, you better tell me ""the wall is coming and you better start pumping those brakes now!"" Deceleration takes time. Third, catastrophe of some sort is NOW. Ask the people who are losing their houses in California wild fires. Or the damage from any of the recent super storms. Or the people of Florida whose streets are flooding. Or the people of Kiribati whose islands are literally disappearing. It may not be a catastrophe for you because you might live above sea level away from the coasts... but it's a catastrophe for many and it will only get worse. Even if you climate change doesn't directly effect you, what will you say when millions of people want to immigrate to your country, because their homes are unlivable?

Dissenting opinions do have a hard time being heard: but that's because the massive consensus of science has already proven Climate Change to be real. You won't find much scientific funding for mercury as medicine anymore because mercury has been proven poisonous. You won't find much anti-vax research because vaccines have been proven safe.

OK, you can name 1 scientist who feels like they can't speak out. Almost every other scientist believes climate change exists. So, just because one scientist feels silenced, you don't believe the rest?

The funny thing about ""false doomsday predictions"" is if you do something to STOP DOOMSDAY, then the doomsday prediction will be wrong. But that doesn't mean the prediction was useless. Scientist and politicians worked hard to prevent Y2K doomsday. We didn't have doomsday. They worked hard to stop acid rain. We don't have an acid rain problem. They worked hard to stop the hole in the ozone layer (the ozone is pretty safe now... except China is breaking the rules and making the ozone hole bigger.) They worked hard to stop nuclear war and we haven't had a nuke used in anger since WWII.

If someone predicts doomsday and you take actions to stop it, that doesn't mean the doomsday prediction was bad: It meant you took an action to fix it and the prediction served its purpose. "

Assuming that human GHG emissions represent one of the main threats to civilization in the future, it's critical that everybody get over their own hangups and support the most appropriate responses.  I'm all about solar, wind and battery tech.  I even spent too much money on a Tesla in order to support that direction.  But it's just going to take too long for those technologies to develop enough to substantively replace fossil fuels for energy production.  Nuclear can do it in very short order."

,"I have logic. ~80% of our energy comes from fossil fuels. Less than 3% comes from wind and solar. The only possible way you could get rid of fossil fuels in 12 years is if we massively decreased our energy consumption.

Every bit as important is the reliability of the energy source. Try running a hospital or government on intermittent energy sources like wind or solar.

How is agriculture going to be done? The entire industry is heavily dependent on diesel. How is it going to be transported and refrigerated?

How are people going to heat their houses in the winter and cool them in the summer?

And that’s to say nothing of the impact to the economy. Data centers and the internet backbone use huge amounts of energy. Bye bye internet. Tech companies, the oil industry, transportation industry, the travel industry, the construction industry, etc. are all heavily dependent on huge amounts of energy and employ huge numbers of people.

Here’s another fundamental problem. Energy from wind and solar are very expensive. Wind energy, for example, is five times as expensive as coal energy.

,"I could name 20 non-alarmists off the top of my head. Check out the [Oregon petition](http://www.petitionproject.org) for a list of 30,000+ more.

Heres’s a small sampling of doomsday predictions that didn’t come true because they were flat wrong, not because drastic action was taken to avert them:

 1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”

2. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.

3. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”

4. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”

5. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”

6. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”

7. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.

8. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”

9. In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”

10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”

11. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.

12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.

13. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).

14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.'”

15. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.

16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”

17. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”

18. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”"

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anthropocene#The_Beginning%3F"
Equip me in the debate on global warming,"Hey Reddit,

Since the start of my awareness of global warming I've been in support of the wealth of science supporting the theories about human activity affecting our climate. Recently I've been in discussions with seemingly learned people who questioned these beliefs and as a person who likes to get my data the right way I went about researching the topic when I came upon a very interesting article review about the subject in support of skepticism.

The article, ""The Global Warming Debate: A Review of the State of Science"" by Khandekar et. al. is from 2005, which is a noteworthy amount of time in such a well researched field. It's an interesting read though. (Not sure if I can link, Google scholar provides the pdf)

I then went about trying to find follow-up on the points made and if they have been clarified in recent studies but I've kind of hit a dead end.

Basically what I'm asking is: if and how the criticisms laid out by the authors have been dispelled. If you can offer some answers or at least point me in the right direction I'd be much obliged. 

The criticisms in question are mainly about:
The effect of urbanisation and land-use change
Solar variability
Extreme weather events and whether it's more a perceptional change rather than an actual change

If you haven't read the article please do. I'm not interested in general responses about what the science today is in agreement of (I am aware and not disputing it), but rather looking for answers on the specifics brought up in the article."
,"The article presents three separate arguments as the ""case against global warming,"" so let's take a look at each in detail.

# Heat-island effect

>Among the important issues that we discuss here are:  
>  
>1: Mean temperature calculation and the impact of urbanization and land-use change; mean temperature changes on regional and hemispheric scale and their variation in the context of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and other mechanisms.

Khandekar et al. suggest that the urbanization induced heat island effect could account for some of the observed **global** warming. Remarkably, they actually offer nothing in the way of support for this suggestion in their own paper, instead relying on the citation of observed **local** effects. Notably. every paper that they cite for the **global** contribution of the heat-island effect suggests a small contribution, (Jones et al. 1990, Hansen et al. 1997).

Indeed, a landmark paper by [Wickham et al. (2013)](http://www.scitechnol.com/2327-4581/2327-4581-1-104.pdf), associated with the independent scientific organization [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/), essentially put to rest this supposition. Berkeley Earth, I will note, was set up with the [explicit intention](http://berkeleyearth.org/about/) to treat seriously the concerns of skeptics. Their analysis represented the largest ensemble of station data at the time, 39,300 temperature stations. In the paper they compared the global temperature trend from ""very-rural"" stations to all other stations. Their analysis contradicted the Urban-Heat Island hypothesis, and as summarized rather bluntly on their [FAQ](https://berkeleyearth.org/archive/faq/#question-15) page,

>Our UHI paper analyzing this indicates that the urban heat island effect on our global estimate of land temperatures is **indistinguishable from zero**.

From the paper,

>We observe the **opposite** of an urban heating effect over the period 1950 to 2010, with a slope of -0.10 ± 0.24°C/100yr (2σ error) in the Berkeley Earth global land temperature average. The confidence interval is **consistent with a zero urban heating effect**, and at most a small urban heating effect (less than 0.14°C/100yr, with 95% confidence) on the scale of the observed warming (1.9 ± 0.1°C/100 yr since 1950 in the land average from Figure 5A).

[Figure 5](https://skepticalscience.com/pics/BESTfig3.jpg) shows that the trend in global temperature rise of all sites and rural sites.

# Solar Variability

>2. The impact of solar variability on climate change (and global warming) in geological times as well as on shorter time scales of a few hundred to a few thousand years

In support of their conjecture that solar variability could explain some of the observed global warming they offer two lines of argumentation, which should be distinguished: firstly, that the sun has driven climate change over geological timescales; secondly, that the sun could be driving climate change over the observed record.

The first argument is an obvious non-sequitur, and irrelevant to the issue at hand. Changes in the sun's irradiance on timescales of hundreds of thousands, or millions of years says nothing of variability on decadal timescales. I will not engage further with this asinine argument, which is **willfully** in bad faith.

Now to the second argument. In support of their argument, they cite Lean et. al (1995), Lean and Rind (1998), and Rind and Overpeck (1993), among other sources.

>These studies now suggest that solar forcing can be significant and may have contributed significantly to the observed warming of the earth’s surface. According to LEAN et al. (1995) and LEAN and RIND (1998), solar forcing may have contributed to about half of the observed warming of 0.55 C since 1860 and about one third of the warming since 1970. Lean and Rind further state that since 1970, GHG forcing has been significantly larger than solar forcing and consequently the solar forcing signal in the global warming data cannot be easily isolated. Other studies, notably by RIND and OVERPECK (1993), SOON et al. (1996) and POSMENTIER et al. (1998) have suggested that up to 78% of earth’s warming between 1885 and 1987 can be accounted for by an increase in the sun’s irradiance

Let's see what Lean and Rind have said since 2005... [Lean and Rind (2008)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL034864) found that anthropogenic forcing is the only explanation for the trend in global average temperatures from 1905-2005. They found that natural forcings were at least an order of magnitude lesser than anthropogenic forcing, and that solar forcing ""contributed negligible long-term warming in the past 25 years, and 10% of the warming in the past 100 years.""

It is now virtually undisputed that direct solar forcing from variations in activity could not have contributed to the period of most rapid global warming since 1975, because we have by then direct measurements of total solar irradiance, [which has decreased over that period](https://www.carbonbrief.org/why-the-sun-is-not-responsible-for-recent-climate-change/).

# Sea-Level Rise

Quoting from Khandekar again,

>3. Consequences of global warming in terms of the ‘‘increase in mean sea-level and in extreme weather events world-wide.’’  
>  
>Sea level has been rising naturally since the end of the last ice age and this has not accelerated recently.

This is just brazenly false, and it was actually false when it was written. In sole support of this claim they cite... a now defunct climate denial blog... As a matter of fact, evidence was already mounting by 2005 of an acceleration in global sea level rise.

[Cazenave et al. (2003),](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026238318585)

>For the last four decades, thermal contribution is estimated to about 0.5 mm/yr, with a possible accelerated rate of thermosteric rise during the 1990s. Topex/Poseidon shows an increase in mean sea level of 2.5 mm/yr over the last decade, a value about two times larger than reported by historical tide gauges. This would suggest that there has been significant acceleration of sea level rise in the recent past, possibly related to ocean warming.

[Evidence for enhanced coastal sea level rise during the 1990s](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004GL019626)

>We present evidence from altimeter data that the rate of sea level rise around the global coastline was significantly in excess of the global average over the period 1993–2002. We also show that the globally-averaged rate of coastal sea level rise for the decade centered on 1955 was significantly larger than any other decade during the past 55 years. In some models of sea level rise, enhanced coastal rise is a pre-cursor of global average rise.

[Onset of recent rapid sea-level rise in the western Atlantic Ocean](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379105001344)

>The 19th century sea level rose at a mean rate of 1.6 mm/yr. Between AD 1900 and AD 1920, sea-level rise accelerated to the modern mean rate of 3.2 mm/yr. This acceleration corresponds in time with global temperature rise and may therefore be associated with recent global warming.

Strangely, Khandekar didn't see fit to cite any of this published research on the topic, or offer a correction to their submitted article, instead citing only a single blog... Fun fact, they cite this blog eight times in their paper, making it their singularly most relied upon source. What a joke.

The following year, [Church and White (2006)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL024826) would publish their seminal work confirming the predictions of the previous IPCC reports. A prediction, I will note, *by Khandekar's own reasoning* (since they claimed there was no evidence of an acceleration), must be completely inexplicable without the help of climate models.

>A reconstruction of global sea level using tide-gauge data from 1950 to 2000 indicates a larger rate of rise after 1993 and other periods of rapid sea-level rise but no significant acceleration over this period. Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 ± 0.006 mm yr−2. This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the IPCC TAR.

# More to come.... but need I continue?"
,"The paper is pretty much a faceplate for denial. They use the 1998 super El Nino, questionable past measurements, claimed urban heat island causation, and so on. There has been almost 20 years of scientific data since that. If they accept that scientific paper why not 20 years of subsequent scientific papers pointing to human causation? Why are they picking and choosing what to believe instead of reading the emerging science? The warming is due to increases in tropospheric radiation at the 15 micron band and water vapor continuum as shown by Harries, 2001, Griggs 2007 and up to the most recent paper by brindley

,"There is no debate.

Even if there's natural variability what humans are doing is vastly amplifying it.

Anyone who doesn't accept human driven climate change at this point just needs to be worked around and ignored. You'll never bring them with you and the time for talk is over."
,I passionately believe in global warming. Please help me to inderstand why l do.
,"Keep in mind that 99% of the population that searches the web for climate change science ONLY gets Pro-Climate Alarmism websites and are NOT given access to all of the data. 

Simply go back and watch Al Gore’s movie “An Inconvenient Truth” with a pen and a notepad. Write down all his predictions in that movie and te dates they were supposed to happen. 

Al Gore clearly had the latest data and the best scientists hires to compile all the climate data we had at that time and as you heard there first,”The Science is Settled…”. Any human being on any side of this debate can see that Al Gore and his team scored a 0.00% from that movie. 

The Earth was threatened of an ice age in the early 1970s & in fact, the earth has cooled from 2017-2020 yet almost ZERO media outlets would publish or air these findings. 

This is all theory. Yes we are warming, and cooling, and changing. 

Water vapor in our atmosphere affects temperature significantly more than the 0.04% (parts per million) of CO2 that everyone is freaking out about. 

Google the relationship between CO2 & Temps in the Eocene & Pleistocene eras. The data suggests almost no real relation between CO2 and temperature. 

Also notice that the temperature changes on Mars has almost mirrored the earth (different temps but the lines are almost exactly parallel), so the temperature raises and cools on Mara at the same rate as Earth yet there are no humans, no Diesel engines, no fracking, no volcanoes (that we know of yet), and no green plants. 

I am not making any kind of conclusion here, just pointing out factors that you will never, ever,ever,ever,ever,ever,ever hear from NASA or 98+% of Scientists. 

We will still be here in 100 years and wonder why we killed fossil fuels in the first place."
,"I think one of the most important skills to learn is to choose steel manning opposing arguments instead of straw manning and learning how to counter those arguments.  Those who quote old papers with low quality of evidence likely won't have their opinion changed anyway if it's like a religion to them.  But steel manning someone else's arguments at least shows that you are listening to them, so they might listen to you more.

One decent enough site to practice on is the ""Daily Skeptic"", which is generally contrarian of standard narratives on principle.  That's what their idea of a skeptic is, and there is a place for that.  I know the standard response to a site like that is to completely dismiss it or attack the writers/editors, but it's still good practice to identify if there's any valid criticism they have and general quality of evidence.  While there are articles on there that are completely bonkers, there also exist good faith articles too with valid points. Pointing out a bonkers article and using that to dismiss everything on the site is essentially what straw manning and poisoning the well is.  The point is to gain practice filtering through bad arguments.   Learning to only counter stupid, rehashed arguments is not going to convince anyone."

,"As an astronomer, the ""solar variability"" always pisses me off, probably because it's the one that touches my area of expertise most closely so it seems like the most obvious bad-faith argument. Like, we can **see** the Sun, right? We can tell it's not responsible, there's no comparable increase in the energy we get from it, it is, as you point out, going *the other direction*. This isn't even that hard to measure. It's just a willful misdirection and lie."

,"Friend keep it up. I am a geochemist that is finding traction in a niche community that has a disproportionate amount of climate deniers and fossil fuel simps. While the community has a fair number of STEM people, most come from pure disciplines. So they know the basics but are generally unfamiliar with the quirks, minutia, and counter-intuitiveness inherent to the Earth system. This allows the fossil bros to pull out shit like glacial rebound in Alaska, Stratospheric temp avg, saturation arguments, etc. uncontested. So they think they are right but then when I show up and counter them they feel stupid and either block me or STFU. Keep it up dude and let's kill this anti science bullshit."

,Is no one going to comment on Poseidon being a contributor to a paper on the rise in sea levels?
,"And this, folks, is how you peer review. No insults, no rising to bait, just clean evidence and reputable sources."
,"I have a completely non-scientific observation to explain the validity and danger of man-made climate change.

For almost decades, roughly 2000-2015, we heard the deniers, some willfully ignorant and some deliberately obfuscating, use the words ""climate alarmist"" or ""global warming alarmist.""

You rarely hear that accusation any more.  Maybe from a neighbor or family friend who is probably also anti-vaxxer, but the cacophony of cries from the right using the word ""alarmist"" have almost disappeared.  Why?  Because the accumulation of catastrophic events of the last decade, and the constant, global warming trend have rendered those pitiful protestations mute.

For example, in a 2006 interview renowned hurricane expert Dr. William Gray claimed there would be a global cooldown within 3 to 4 years.

[https://www.denverpost.com/2006/06/04/chill-out-over-global-warming/](https://www.denverpost.com/2006/06/04/chill-out-over-global-warming/)*""Gray acknowledges that we’ve had some warming the past 30 years. “I don’t question that,” he explains. “And humans might have caused a very slight amount of this warming. Very slight. But this warming trend is not going to keep on going. My belief is that three, four years from now, the globe will start to cool again, as it did from the middle ’40s to the middle ’70s.”*

Others also kept claiming that a cool down was going to happen.  Good luck finding a scientist who will say that and back it up with a peer-reviewed scientific paper."

,"The difference between climate change and the asteroid redirection is the DART mission is just something NASA is doing over there. If they can save us from something external that's great. Whereas climate change is something we are doing to ourselves and not only that we are ALL contributing to it. It requires every one of us in some way or another to take responsibility for their contributions not just directly but how their patronage of businesses incentives those businesses to further contribute to climate change for profit. It's a difficult thing for many people to deal with. Some people will instead choose to believe they can't do anything to avoid that responsibility, be it because of laziness, fear, greed or just apathy. 

Your argument that ""there is something we can do to fight it"" is exactly what these people don't want to know or don't care about. The evidence of anthropic climate change is overwhelming. The people who don't want to see it, don't want to face what they've done to ushur it in and/or don't want to face what they have to do to fight it."
,"I think it's both. Some think we can't do anything. Some think we don't have to do anything. And others think we shouldn't do anything if we could. For a variety of their own reasons that are subjective. They are, of course wrong, according to a glut of evidence, but that is all merely to point out why they are inactive on fixing climate change even after accepting it is happening."
,"That doesn't matter. The sun is just getting hotter so unless we can shoot a rocket full of water to cool the sun down a bit, it will cool off on it's own in time.  /s

You need to understand that arguments against climate change are not made in good faith. They don't give a damn about the environment beyond how it immediately affect them. What they want is to drive their Hummer on $1/gal fuel. All they care about is not paying taxes and fees and having more money.

(emphasis mine). And Jeremiah 2:7:

>And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in, you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.

And even Revelations:

Our relationship with the earth and animals and plants should be one of cooperation and respect rather than domination and subjugation. If god exists in the format Christians believe, he should know these things."

Genesis 1:26 and 1:28, respectively. 

""Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”


And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

Their climate change denial boils down to the belief that God created the Earth, it is not possible to affect God's plan, therefore it's impossible for humans to destroy the planet. Also, God gave humans “dominion over… every living thing that moves upon the Earth,” which some interpret to mean mankind has free reign to do whatever they want to the planet. “God said it's okay, and it's not like we could do any real damage, anyway, because it's all part of God's plan.”

Fundamentalists insist that the book is entirely without error and is 100% divine revelation - of course they're going to work harder to make it seem all self-consistent.

Never affected his faith, just meant he taught us to look for the lessons behind the words rather than taking the words at face value."

My argument is more along the lines of ""if the majority of Christians, especially the most ardent of them, claim that their religion says X, that's pretty good evidence that they're correct."" So I've grown more skeptical of attempts to ""reclaim"" or ""reform"" Christianity to be in line with modern values.

As I think about this more, the real problem with trying to reclaim Christianity is that even if you're successful, people are still using the Bible as their source of authority, not their reason. That's the same with a liberal or a fundamentalist Christian. And these reforms tend to lag social change, not lead it. See liberal churches and gay marriage, for example. It was only once it became self-evident to a lot of people that being gay wasn't immoral that people began to reinterpret the Bible in this light."

The fun thing about studying history is watching groups of Christians split off from other groups and re-interperet the text to be more aligned with their own values. Who the 'majority' is really depends on what time period & location you're looking at.

Church philosopher Augustine in 340-430 emphasized a focus on the Bible, rather than church officials as the ultimate religious authority. He preached that 'only god can bestow salvation by his divine grace', and grace could not be earned - but the Catholic church in the middle ages taught that salvation was possible through righteous 'good works' that pleased god. They said **you had to** ***do good*** **in order to get to heaven. Thinking good thoughts wasn't enough.** They taught that for centuries.

In 1517, scholar-monk Martin Luther penned a document. (He had a doctorate after studying at the University of Erfurt and another university in Wittenberg, and was a professor of biblical studies, and studied Augustine's work in depth.) In his document, he attacked the Catholic church's increasingly corrupt practice of selling ""Indulgences"" to absolve sin. In exchange for certain prayers, ***donations***, or pilgrimages in special years, a Catholic could receive an *indulgence*, which reduced or erased the punishment of sinning instantly, with no formal ceremony or sacrament. This quickly became: 'rich people can pay off the church and sin as much as they want with no spiritual consequence, because the church can use money to help people....or just make their stuff nicer.'

Martin Luther is famously painted nailing his dissertation: ""Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences"" also called ""95 Theses"" to the doors of the Wittenberg Castle church.

The document basically said that god intended believers to seek repentance. That their *faith*, not their deeds, would lead to salvation.  In addition, he criticized the church directly: ""*Why does not* ***the pope,*** *whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build the basilica of St. Peter with* ***his own money*** *rather than with the money of poor believers?*""

Pope Leo X concluded Luther's writings were heretical, and that he should publicly recant. King Henry VIII in England agreed & the pope gave him a nice title. Luther refused. He was excommunicated from the church in 1521. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V ordered his writings to be burned, but they'd already been spread across Germany.

Before all this began, Luther was mostly known for his writings about how clerics of the church (priests, friars, monks, etc.) should be allowed to fuck. As the Protestant Reformation sparked and spread across Europe, Luther wasn't really involved - he had married an ex-nun and had 5 children with her. In a time where chamber-pots were still common, he had a toilet with a seat & dedicated cesspit under it, in a bathroom with a heated floor. The man fucked.

About a decade later, King Henry VII decided his wife wasn't getting pregnant fast enough so he wanted to divorce Catherine & hook up with one of her ladies in waiting (Anne). Unlucky for him the holy roman empire had just destroyed Rome, forcing the pope to flee. Papacy now almost entirely under HRE control, Henry needed imperial permission as well as pope permission to divorce Catherine.Coincidentally, the *Emperor* of the holy roman empire already Catherine's favorite nephew, King-of-Spain Clement VII. As you can imagine, favorite-nephew-emperor-king Clement VII was not inclined to grant the divorce.

They waffled for a bit, Henry got impatient, and Protestants Cranmer and Cromwell, advisors to Henry, built a case that England's king shouldn't be subject to the pope's jurisdiction. 'Great idea!' said Henry as he appointed Cranmer as the archbishop of Canterbury, so Cranmer could grant Henry's divorce from Catherine. In 1533, Anne was already very obviously already pregnant when she was crowned queen of England. England's Protestant reformation began.

""*Belief* is more important than *deeds*"" said the protestants. ""You can't *pay* to have sin absolved, god is above money!""Disgraceful Heretics,"" said the Eastern Orthodox Catholics ""Thinking happy thoughts doesn't actually improve the world god gave us, and respecting/glorifying His temple is in scripture!""

Funny enough, Henry VIII apparently remained a conservative catholic who hated Martin Luthor until his death. Despite the reformation of his whole-ass country, he wasn't a protestant 🤷"

Also, ""majority of christians are catholics"" and ""majority of catholics believe in climate change"" does not imply ""majority of christians believe in climate change"" (especially since catholics are barely a majority globally). That being said:

It seems like catholics basically track exactly with the US average on various climate change questions: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/06/16/catholics-divided-over-global-warming/

In this survey, catholics were the third most likely religious group to be against environmental protections, after mormons and evangelical protestants: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/views-about-environmental-regulation/
Mainline protestants were indistinguishable from catholics, and pretty much any other religion was much more likely to support regulations.

To your point that american catholics are more liberal than protestants: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/political-ideology/
We see pretty much the exact same results. Catholics are more liberal than mormons and evangelicals, neck and neck with mainline protestants, and more conservative than any other religion group.

It's possible these numbers have changed, but that sort of proves my point: religious reform tends to lag behind social changes, not lead them. If catholicism had a unique insight on moral issues, they would've led the US in belief in climate change, and lobbied for changes to be made."

,"Will the correlation between the atmospheric CO2 level and the average global temperature soon start to fall apart?

When I look at graphs comparing atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average temperature, such as this one: [https://johnenglander.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CO2-Temperature%20420%20kyr.gif](https://johnenglander.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CO2-Temperature%20420%20kyr.gif) , I see a very obvious relationship that spans across past millennia. However, I also see that the trends in CO2 concentration tend to follow that of the temperature. In other words, higher or lower temperatures seem to cause higher or lower amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere, and not the other way around. This is contrary to the mainstream narrative of anthropogenic global warming. This is especially apparent in how drops in the CO2 level tend to lag drops in temperature, often by many centuries.

One explanation given is that the oceans have historically been the greatest contributor to atmospheric CO2. Higher ocean temperatures mean they release more CO2 into the atmosphere, and lower ocean temperatures mean that they are better at absorbing it. Since the oceans are so big and it can take a very long time to either heat or cool them compared to the air and the land, this could explain the lag in the relationship.

The atmospheric CO2 level has shot up since the start of the Industrial Revolution. This unnatural increase is apparent at the far right end of the graph I linked to above. Supposedly, the atmospheric CO2 concentration today is the highest it's been in almost a million years. That may well be true, and it seems obvious to me that a lot of the recent increase has been due to human activity. But if CO2 emissions (whether natural or man-made) don't actually contribute to higher temperatures, but are merely a symptom of it, then we shouldn't expect the global average temperature to follow the same curve. The world may suddenly start to cool from other causes (such as quieting solar activity, changes in Earth's orbit, less heat being transferred from the Earth's core, or some other forces that are still poorly understood) and yet the atmospheric CO2 level may keep rising from fossil fuel emissions regardless. Alternatively, these or other natural forces could keep global temperatures rising even as human civilization abandons fossil fuels and uses cleaner sources of energy (such as space-based solar power, which I see as being in our future).

Even within the short time span that human industrial activity has massively contributed to CO2 emissions, I see important clues that it's not the cause for the recent global warming. Here's a graph showing the average global temperature and the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past 150 years: [https://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource\_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/22/05/f91f3e0f9de762a469592dc44804/CS\_global\_temp\_and\_co2\_1880-2012\_V3.png?itok=\_eLJDZSz](https://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/22/05/f91f3e0f9de762a469592dc44804/CS_global_temp_and_co2_1880-2012_V3.png?itok=_eLJDZSz) Notice that between roughly 1940 and 1975, the global average temperature wasn't rising, and even dipped slightly. In the 1970's, many scientists and the mainstream media were warning of an impending ice age based on the previous few decades of data. Yet during this period, the atmospheric CO2 level began to rise precipitously, likely due to the post-war industrial boom. Also notice that, between roughly 1910 and 1940, the rate of the global average temperature increase was about the same (if not more) than the rate of increase between 1975 and the present. But the atmospheric CO2 level was only gradually increasing during the former period, as human industrial activity was not yet widespread.

So in conclusion, I think that there historically really was a relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentration and the average global temperature, but the relationship was the inverse of what the mainstream narrative has led most to believe. Do you think, now that human activity contributes a significant chunk to CO2 emissions, and that temperature changes are likely due to unrelated causes, that the relationship between the two could soon fall apart?"

You don't understand much apparently.  The cause of temperature increases and decreases, with the corresponding increases and decreases in CO2 over the last million years is due to Milankovitch Cycles.  This is very very well understood https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles

----

We know that we have increased CO2 levels by burning ancient carbon (oil, coal, natural gas) by looking at the relative isotopes of C12, C13, and C14.

>During all of the cycles between ice ages and warm periods over the past million years, atmospheric carbon dioxide never climbed higher than 300 parts per million. At the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago, it was 280 ppm. Today it is close to 410. The increase between the year 1800 and today is 70% larger than the increase that occurred when Earth climbed out of the last ice age between 17,500 and 11,500 years ago, and it occurred 100-200 times faster. Only fossil fuels—which are the remains of millions of years of carbon uptake by plants—contain enough carbon to produce such a massive change in such a short time.

>In addition, only fossil fuels are consistent with the isotopic fingerprint of the carbon in today’s atmosphere. Different kinds of carbon-containing material have different relative amounts of “light” carbon-12, “heavy” carbon-13, and radioactive carbon-14. Plant matter is enriched in carbon-12, because its lighter weight is more readily used by plants during photosynthesis. Volcanic emissions are enriched in carbon-13. The ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere and the ocean are roughly the same. Since carbon-14 is radioactive, it decays predictably over time. Young organic matter has more carbon-14 than older organic matter, and fossil fuels have no measurable carbon-14 at all.

>As carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen over the past century or more, the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 has fallen, which means that the source of the extra carbon dioxide must be enriched in ""light"" carbon-12. Meanwhile, the relative amount of carbon-14—radioactive carbon—has declined. The record of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is complicated by nuclear bomb testing after 1950, which doubled the amount of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere. After the nuclear test ban treaty in 1963, the excess atmospheric carbon-14 began to decline as it dispersed into the oceans and the land biosphere.

>In the last four decades, however, the decline of carbon-14 has been noticeably faster than can be explained by continuing dispersal of the bomb-related carbon-14. This faster decline is driven by the addition to the atmosphere of huge amounts of carbon dioxide from a source with no carbon-14. As this carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it dilutes the ratio of 14-carbon dioxide (i.e., carbon dioxide containing a carbon-14 atom) to total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

>Taken together, then, we are looking for a source of carbon dioxide that comes from terrestrial plants (because they are depleted in ""heavy"" carbon-13), is so old that any carbon-14 it once contained has decayed to non-detectable levels, and is capable of creating a pulse of carbon dioxide that is larger and faster than anything that’s occurred in at least the past million years. Only fossil fuels meet all those criteria.

,"Really? Sounds like he had a good grasp of it, regardless of his confusion over chemistry.

Contrary to what you're implying, this isn't rocket science. It doesn't take a huge leap of intuition to understand that if you add more of a gas to the atmosphere that traps heat, the Earth might in fact get hotter over time. Of course, global warming is more complex than that, because the Earth is a complex system. Most people think that a 2 or 3 or 5 degree shift in temperature isn't a big deal, because if the temperature is 75 one day and 80 the next, nobody dies from that. What they fail to consider is how much energy that represents when applied to the entire planet, especially the oceans, which trap vast amounts of energy and drive global weather patterns. 5 degrees won't kill humans, but it might well kill plankton or other tiny creatures that are a critical part of the food chain, that could well trigger at least a partial collapse of an ecosystem that feeds a billion people. 5 degrees won't kill humans but it might kill insects or disrupt their breeding patterns enough to cause a population collapse and interfere with pollination or other food chains. 5 degrees might not kill humans but it might melt enough ice to flood cities and land where hundreds of millions of people live. If the glaciers of Greenland melt, which it's now projected they will, most of southern Florida, Louisiana, and large parts of the coasts of Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, among others, ***will be under water***.

[here is Carl Sagan testifying in congress in 1985 on the green house effect and global warming](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp-WiNXH6hI)

And here is a quote from cosmos 

“There is an additional factor that can alter the landscape and the climate of Earth: intelligent life, able to make major environmental changes. Like Venus, the Earth also has a greenhouse effect due to its carbon dioxide and water vapor. The global temperature of the Earth would be below the freezing point of water if not for the greenhouse effect. It keeps the oceans liquid and life possible. A little greenhouse is a good thing. Like Venus, the Earth also has about 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide; but it resides in the crust as limestone and other carbonates, not in the atmosphere. If the Earth were moved only a little closer to the Sun, the temperature would increase slightly. This would drive some of the CO2 out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, which would in turn incrementally heat the surface further. A hotter surface would vaporize still more carbonates into CO2, and there would be the possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect to very high temperatures. This is just what we think happened in the early history of Venus, because of Venus' proximity to the Sun. The surface environment of Venus is a warning: something disastrous can happen to a planet rather like our own.  

The principal energy sources of our present industrial civilization are the so-called fossil fuels. We burn wood and oil, coal and natural gas, and, in the process, release waste gases, principally CO2, into the air. Consequently, the carbon dioxide content of the Earth's atmosphere is increasing dramatically. The possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect suggests that we have to be careful: Even a one- or two- degree rise in the global temperature can have catastrophic consequences. In the burning of coal and oil and gasoline, we are also putting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Like Venus, our stratosphere even now has a substantial mist of tiny sulfuric acid droplets. Our major cities are polluted with noxious molecules. We do not understand the long- term effects of our course of action….”

,"It literally is discussed and involved in every branch if science. When I got my biotech diploma it was brought up in chemistry class when discussing chemical equilibrium between CO2 in the air and carbonic acid in the ocean. Add more CO2 to the air, morsle dissolves into the water and reacts to create carbonic acid, pH goes down. Remove some from the air and the ocean would release some. It was also discussed when it came to various applications of biotech like biofuel and more efficient farming prqctices. Then when I did my BA in life science it was brought uo again in ecology classes, again in plant biology classes as invasive plants from warmer regions can settle in newer places. Brought up in anthro classes when discussing the various climate change events and causes of the past as well as applications of carbon dating (due to fossil fuels being burried in the ground away from the suns cosmic rays, but carbon based life like trees on the surface aren't, you can use carbon dating to tell how much carbon came from cellular respiration and forest fires, and how much came from ground sources like volcanoes and fossil fuels. It was brought up in physics classes when it came to learning about heat radiating and going from hot to cold, and how greenhouse gasses serve as an insukatir between the surface and space. Like it has literally came up in almost every science course just as a passive and well understood example on applications of said fields as well as how laws of nature work. You could remain completely apolotical, but if you study science you should not just know it is real, but how it is known to some degrees and how some aspects work.

I would recommend reading reputable scientific journals like Nature, PlosOne, Wiley, Science, many more. If the article is behind a paywall you can use Scihub and the DOI to get past it. All peer reviewed. All reputable as that is how they make their money (redacting anything shown to be wrong), and the beautiful thing about journal articles is you get to see their methods and not just take their word on it.

,"https://www.50x30.net/carbon-emissions-from-permafrost

> If we can hold temperatures to 1.5°C, cumulative permafrost emissions by 2100 will be about equivalent to those currently from Canada (150–200 Gt CO2-eq).
>
>  In contrast, by 2°C scientists expect cumulative permafrost emissions as large as those of the EU (220–300 Gt CO2-eq) .
>
>  If temperature exceeds 4°C by the end of the century however, permafrost emissions by 2100 will be as large as those today from major emitters like the United States or China (400–500 Gt CO2-eq), the same scale as the remaining 1.5° carbon budget.

For reference, the anthropogenic emissions in 2019 were were [over 50 Gt CO2 equivalent](https://www.pbl.nl/en/news/2020/growth-of-11-in-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-2019), so whatever permafrost emits by the end of the century, we'll emit in a few years.

To understand what this means in terms of warming: 1000 Gt CO2 leads to between 0.27 and 0.63 degrees of warming (most likely 0.45 degrees; see page 27 [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf)). This means that permafrost emissions would add roughly a quarter of whichever value you go with if the world stays at 2 C this century and half (i.e. 0.2 - 0.3 C) if the world emits up enough to reach 4 C by 2100.

Lastly, permafrost only really emits a lot of methane when it's waterlogged - otherwise, it's plain CO2, though since methane causes much more warming, a small fraction of methane has about the same effect as the remainder being CO2. A [recent study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JG006543) also suggests that unless (or until) the required microorganisms are present in the area, the emissions would be almost entirely CO2 even from waterlogged soils."
,"> methane bubbling up.. it might not even matter

I thought climate scientists had prettty firmly ruled out the clathrate gun hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that warming will release a bunch of methane, which will then lead to large and rapid extra warming). 

I thought scientists ruled this out by looking at the methane released during previous warming periods, and showing that there’s nowhere near enough released to trigger the Clathrate Gun.

So, climate change will be bad, yes, and yes we need to address it. But no, there’s no evidence to suggest such a bad scenario that our actions limiting emissions might not matter."
,"I mean I don’t disagree…but “pathetic” is a bit forthright and crass lol.

Australia just recently changed a number of their policies and greatly influenced their contribution to climate change moving forward (very late to the party mind you). The Greens party now has much greater representation in federal parliament, upper and lower houses. Not saying all countries are as flexible but it’s a start.

Also I think economic and political stability need to be nurtured whilst we transition to a different way of living. All levels of society need to be educated and persuaded tactfully over a significant period of time. Pushing change too quickly may lead to just as much suffering through economic collapse and societal upheaval as climate change! I do understand however that we may not have time up our sleeve."

,"Ehhhhh, not quite. There were legitimate scientific questions about how real it was back then, how large of an effect. It took until the 1950s, with new spectroscopic measurements and more modern science, that we really started to get good handle on the problem. And it was in the 1970s to early 1980s that the scientific community finally came to agreement, leading to the foundation of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which is the official liaison from the scientific community to the rest of the world.

After that, the rest of us have no excuse. The basic science was clear, clear enough to start taking action."

>The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiativ forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years.(...)"

> **Over millennia under any warmer climate, the ice sheet reaches a new steady state**, whose mass is correlated with the magnitude of global climate change imposed. If a climate that gives the recently observed SMB were maintained, global-mean sea level rise (GMSLR) would reach 0.5–2.5 m. For any global warming exceeding 3 K, the contribution to GMSLR exceeds 5 m. For the largest global warming considered (about +5 K), the rate of GMSLR is initially 2.7 mm yr^−1, and eventually only a small ice cap endures, resulting in over 7 m of GMSLR. Our analysis gives a qualitatively different impression from previous work in that we do not find a sharp threshold warming that divides scenarios in which the ice sheet suffers little reduction from those in which it is mostly lost.
>
> The final steady state is achieved by withdrawal from the coast in some places and a tendency for increasing SMB due to enhancement of cloudiness and snowfall over the remaining ice sheet by the effects of topographic change on atmospheric circulation, outweighing the tendency for decreasing SMB from the reduction in surface altitude. If late 20th-century climate is restored after the ice sheet mass has fallen below a threshold of about 4 m of sea level equivalent, it will not regrow to its present extent because the snowfall in the northern part of the island is reduced once the ice sheet retreats from there. **In that case, about 2 m of GMSLR would become irreversible. In order to avoid this outcome, anthropogenic climate change must be reversed before the ice sheet has declined to the threshold mass, which would be reached in about 600 years at the highest rate of mass loss** within the likely range of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

We *are* set to lose enough Antarctic ice to result in several metres of sea level rise from that alone, though.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2727-5

> Here we show that the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits a multitude of temperature thresholds beyond which ice loss is irreversible. Consistent with palaeodata we find, using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, that at global warming levels around 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, West Antarctica is committed to long-term partial collapse owing to the marine ice-sheet instability. Between 6 and 9 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the loss of more than 70 per cent of the present-day ice volume is triggered, mainly caused by the surface elevation feedback. **At more than 10 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, Antarctica is committed to become virtually ice-free**. The ice sheet’s temperature sensitivity is 1.3 metres of sea-level equivalent per degree of warming up to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, almost doubling to 2.4 metres per degree of warming between 2 and 6 degrees and increasing to about 10 metres per degree of warming between 6 and 9 degrees. 

However, that will be just as spread out over many centuries as any Greenland melt.

> Sea-level rise projections and knowledge of their uncertainties are vital to make informed mitigation and adaptation decisions. To elicit projections from members of the scientific community regarding future global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise, we repeated a survey originally conducted five years ago. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, 106 experts projected a likely (central 66% probability) GMSL rise of 0.30–0.65 m by 2100, and 0.54–2.15 m by 2300, relative to 1986–2005. Under RCP 8.5, the same experts projected a likely GMSL rise of 0.63–1.32 m by 2100, and 1.67–5.61 m by 2300. Expert projections for 2100 are similar to those from the original survey, although the projection for 2300 has extended tails and is higher than the original survey.

Where did the 25,000,000,000 GWh figure come from out of interest?

According to [this estimate](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/total-electricity-output-gwh-wb-data.html), total electricity generation in 2014 was about 4,300,000 GWh which is much much smaller that your number above. I know you're citing all energy use but it's too far off surely.

[This article ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States) cites

> Primary energy use in the United States was 90,558 petajoules [PJ] (25,155 TWh)

*That's 25 PWh, not 24,000 PWh.*

Anyway, was doing a similar exercise on a thread about solar in Taiwan for some reason. 

I got 2 useful numbers. Nominal power for solar is about 38W/m2 (if you're in India) and capacity factor is 27%.

So going by the Wikipedia number, 25,000,000 GWh, that would need 

25,000,000 / 365*24 = 2,900 GW of continuous generation

So applying the capacity factor, we get 

2,900 / 0.27 = 10,740GW of nameplate generation

So that's 

10,740,000,000,000/38 of area = 
282,000,000,000 m2
= 282,000 km2
= a square of side 530 km

Kinda huge.

Taken a different way, the USA has a land area of 9,384 million sq km2

So 282,000 km2 is 3% of the total land area. It doesn't seem so bad that way somehow. Still a huuuge area, but hey, there's a lot of desert looking for some useful purpose. According to [this article ](https://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/atmospheric/us-desert-50-years1.htm) 

> More than 30 percent of North America is comprised of arid or semi-arid lands, with about 40 percent of the continental United States at risk for desertification

Btw, Taiwan's number was 3.6%.

Oh, and of course you would also need a huuuge amount of storage to capture and deliver the energy when it's needed.

But, just another thing to mull over. if you had 100 million EVs each with 50KWh of storage and a decent V2G system, that would provide 5,000,000,000 KWh of storage, or 5,000 GWh of storage, against the 2,900GW of generation mentioned above.

No idea how the battery industry will crank out that storage anytime soon, and the V2G won't be nearly efficient to just suck up and deliver that power whenever needed.

But hey, there's also wind which is negatively correlated with solar (it's more windy when the sun isn't at its strongest, and it blows at night just fine)...."

As of the end of December 2018, the United States had [60 nuclear power plants](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=nuclear_use) operating 98 commercial nuclear reactors in 30 of the 50 U.S. states.  
    
The annual Gallup Environment poll, conducted March 1-10, 2019, showed [49% of Americans](https://news.gallup.com/poll/248048/years-three-mile-island-americans-split-nuclear-power.aspx) oppose nuclear energy and 49% favor nuclear energy.    
    
Use and storage of nuclear power and radioactive waste is disputed strongly within the US population. It's a big topic among the portion of the US population who are uncomfortable with the possibility of themselves and their families being at risk of sickness, birth defects of their newborn children, permanent disabilities, or deaths caused by radioactive waste materials or a power plant meltdown."
,People in the US are kept entirely in the dark about nuclear waste since it can be used to build dirty bombs and you can't even trust US citizens not to build bombs out of fertilizer.

Why aren't solar and wind energy better options?

The intermittency and unpredictability of solar and wind are very serious issues. Our entire energy infrastructure is based around the idea that supply ramps up and down to match demand, but solar and wind just give you what you get, often in daily or yearly cycles or just totally unpredictably. It's often more useful to think of energy as a service rather than a commodity. In that sense then how much would you value a mains water supply which sometimes runs dry for a week, or an internet provider which only connects during the daytime?

Mitigating intermittency with large-scale energy storage is arguably a harder problem than generating the energy in the first place. Take a look at this table of energy stored per kg in various types of material. You can see that LNG stores over 60 times the energy per kg than a Lithium-ion battery does, and Uranium stores 92 million times more per kg! The discrepancy in energy density comes from the fact that different fundamental physics processes are involved (in order of increasing storage density: electromagnetism for a capacitor, electrochemical potential for a Li-ion battery, chemical bonds for combustible fossil fuels, and the strong nuclear force for Uranium.) You can't do anything about this because that would first require an enormous breakthrough in fundamental physics or materials science.

What does this imply? This is a bit simplistic, but imagine that the UK experiences a week of low winds in the middle of winter, so they aren't getting much solar either. In that time the UK has demanded maybe roughly 7 TWh of electricity. That's 25 Peta-Joules of electricity. Which sounds easier: having 28 million tons of Li-ion batteries on standby or burning 300kg (roughly the weight of 1 Grand Piano) of extra Uranium? No-one has solved this problem on a big scale anywhere yet. Musk's battery storage facility in Australia has a capacity of 129MWh, so you would need 54000 of those facilities to cover the UK for a week.

Renewables might be able to work better in places that can build their energy infrastructure in tandem with the renewable sources, but that's no help for all the world's major emitters, who have already built their hugely expensive infrastructure.

Intermittent sources also get less cost-effective at higher market penetration. For example if it's a super sunny, and everyone has solar panels giving them loads of electricity, then your solar panels are worth less right now, because no-one wants to buy the energy they produce. I sometimes see headlines like ""solar is now so cheap the cost is sometimes negative!"" but that is clearly inefficient, you would never brag about having to pay someone else to take away all the excess food you bought.

Although the cost of solar panels and wind turbines will fall further, there are fundamental physics limits which stop their energy-production efficiency increasing drastically. They might give you 20% more energy per square metre in the future but they will never give you 10x as much energy per square meter. See the Shockley-Quiesser limit and Betz's law.

When you calculate just how much space would be used up by the renewables capacity required to supply entire countries, they start to look silly. For example, to power the whole UK with just wind turbines would take an offshore wind farm one-third of the size of Wales.

Finally, all renewables are in some way geographically-limited. That's fine for countries like Iceland or Bhutan, who are blessed with plenty of hydro potential, and at least Saudia Arabia would get the most out of any solar panels, but it means that the most efficient global setup would be to have some countries rely upon recieving most of their power from a few others. We know that this kind of geopolitical energy-dependence is undesirable, especially as much of the world's strongest sunlight falls on the Middle East and North Africa, areas not known for their political stability."
,"Dang, bringing receipts and changing my opinions and shit.  I still don't think Nuclear energy is the big bad boogie man it's built up to be, but it seems clear we should be moving heavily into solar and wind while we wait to see if Fusion pans out or not.

,That is what most are doing. I think a multitiered approach is most feasible. Especially in the US where we use a lot of power.
,"Geez, someone doesn't think so. These people are downvoting reality."
,"The reasoning behind placement at a single location is likely the overhead costs associated with each additional solar farm. Not to mention, there are not very many places that could produce 2000 hours per year of sunlight at 1 kW per m^2. Distribution will always be an issue with solar.

Having said that, there are some big and very fundamental issues with HVDC. The article you posted does not cite any sources or provide any data related to the so-called break even point, so I find it very suspect. Also, that break even assumes neither already exists, which is not the case, so there is a huge net loss equaling the cost of the preexisting AC lines. Additionally, they point out that a major disadvantage of HVDC is ""Uncontrollable power flow"" which brings us back to storage as a major issue. That, and I believe the diagram from the OP obviously did not account for a major restructuring of infrastructure of the entire power grid. This is not cheap. Even if a HVDC line system was the solution, the cost would be astronomical, not to mention wasteful since we already have AC infrastructure with decades of experience and expertise on its use, operation, maintenance, etc."
,"Which makes wind an excellent pairing. Look at what’s projected for California to ease the solar duck curve there, wind and a mix of storage and gas (assuming there isn’t a future policy lever that speeds up storage deployment and obviates the need for peaker plants)"
,"If I could reply to your comment in one word it would be: Worth.

I don't know why you're hammering the wildlife habitat thing, it's practically a non-issue. We would probably place at least 2/3 of the panels on roofs of existing buildings. ~~And it's not like solar panels really screw up habitats. We're not plowing down rainforests, just mounting the panels on some supports on flat ground in the middle of nowhere and creating shade underneath. Oh no.~~ <--- OK I was wrong about this. But still, worth.

The point I most agree with is having to dig and lay more electrical lines. This would still be worth it. It'd be crazy expensive and more destructive than erecting the panels themselves but after it was all said and done the infrastructure would be set and ready to go for decades upon decades.

Schlepped to the NE? Electricity travels near the speed of light. Yes obviously solar panels are made by mostly coal power. That wasn't a real question, it went along with my next rhetorical question right after. That's the only way to build them as of now unless some 100% renewable solar manufacturer comes along. But the more solar in the world the less coal powers our everyday needs. How the hell are we ever going to achieve 100% renewable energy without some carbon cost? We aren't. But there isn't any better way to spend that carbon cost than on the road to renewable energy.

80% output over 20 years is nearly negligible, 80% after 20 years is very good. By that time we'd have more than enough clean energy from those solar panels to cover the manufacturing for the 20% decrease.

I mean what's the alternative? We just keep going with coal and oil with no push for solar/wind because it'd be expensive and damage the environment a bit? Better to eventually hit 100% renewable at a low carbon cost than keep going with our current shit show of a situation with coal and oil powering everything, polluting every day."

Larger turbines are *much* more reliable. Costs are dropping ridiculously quickly too, with subsidy-free plants coming online from 2020 (despite the fact fossil fuels are still heavily subsidised in the UK at least, Nuclear historically has required subsidies to secure investment). Five years ago I would have agreed with you, but the costs of renewable power are dropping so quickly that investing in new nuclear (which would come online in ~2030 at the earliest) seems not as vital anymore, though an increase in baseload would still be nice. Also, my hopes have been slightly tarnished by the conservative government here fucking up the contracts for 90% of the promised new nuclear capacity for the UK in the past few years. In any case, the primary option for electricity generation should be massive investments into wind, hydro or solar as appropriate.

Also, with the new wind turbine sizes, each powering ~16000 homes, it would only require ~1700 offshore turbines to power the whole UKs household (but not industrial) electricity usage, say 3400 at 50% capacity factor.

Edit: Using Betz's law to calculate the maximum doesn't account for increase in turbine height, which has a greater-than-linear effect on power generation for at least the next few size increments (increase in swept area in *z*, stronger and more reliable winds)."

,"**Pumped-storage hydroelectricity**

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing.  The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power.

,That’s kind of a straw man from what I was saying. Gas has a transitional role in a world where renewable and storage (ITC) subsidies are phasing out and fossil fuel and nuclear subsidies are not. I’m not a proponent of nat gas but nuclear can’t happen fast enough to play the transitional role that gas is and since it’s so baseload oriented it also doesn’t solve for intermittency. Storage + renewables will replace gas before new nuclear technology is market ready and financeable (outside of just dropping on rate payers perhaps) and subsequently constructed and operational. And why is wind and solar so carbon intensive in your mind relative to nuclear? Everything I’ve heard is manufacturing lifecycle. But that’s true of any industrial activity and nuclear is no exception. Also seriously worth considering is water usage. Wind uses water for cement and toilets and solar water usage for dust washing is like 3% or something and that is a loss that tech improvements will rapidly be able to internalize.

Within a decade we could be seeing commercial reactors which are far cheaper than current designs while being intrinsically safe and extraordinarily efficient.

Only with storage, and then with hefty subsidies.  Even then the storage attached is suitably only for FCAS duties supporting the grid for a mere hour or so, not for getting people through the night."
,If wind and solar are at 50% then that's ideal for nuclear.  The last 50% of renewable installation will be exponentially more difficult to implement than the first 50%.  Nuclear energy provides the means by which we can shortcut that and make a real effort to avert climate change.
,"That’s right but you don’t need those nuclear plants with emerging technology if you’re pairing storage with wind and solar and maybe in the future tidal etc. it’s when you couple storage with intermittent resources that you can replace both caseload and peaking generation and since cost isn’t apparently an issue given the nuclear context, you can diversify into less competitive storage choices that can store for longer periods of time so you have generation reserves and so forth"
,"With ""heavy subsidies"" which are just counter acting almost 50% import duties imposed by our wise leaders. Solar is competitive subsidy free in at least the EU, India and China. Today."
,I'm not against nuclear. I just see zero chance of it being competitive in mitigating climate change compared to solar and wind.
,"Thankfully nuclear isn't being driven from the grid by wind and solar, it's being driven from the grid by cheap frack gas.  If we implement the policy changes needed to reflect the true cost of frack gas exploitation then all carbon-free generation sources will benefit.  Wind and solar may beat extant nuclear on cost when they're generating, but we're still orders of magnitude away from having the storage to beat the CalISO Duck curve, let alone keep the lights on through the night.  Nuclear provides that backup.  Going to advanced nuclear lets us directly supply carbon-free process heat to get at markets which will otherwise be extremely slow to adopt renewable energy.  

it might be too late to beat climate change, but we can at least mitigate its impact.  Except all options must be on the table.  Dismissing one source of carbon-free energy because of our prejudices dooms us to a future ravaged by the worst possible outcome of global warming."

Climate change was still pretty unknown in 1987, and very few people understood how it would play out, or how soon it would happen. It just wasn't something people talked about. I get that you're looking at it from 2019 eyes, so I'll give you half a point for that.

As for the rest of it, at no point does Calvin's Mom express her opinion on climate change, nor is she accused of ""not doing enough"", which is rather important to your interpretation that she doesn't care or isn't doing enough.

>the older generation somewhat feels like the younger generation are acting like entitled brats sometimes'

Calvin acted like an entitled brat a LOT. That's a big part of his character.

And frankly, the vast majority of young folks today who complain about the older generations not doing enough for climate change are MASSIVE FUCKING HYPOCRITES who aren't even coming close to living their own lives in a way that minimizes carbon emissions and encourages businesses to operate in a green manner.

Basically the person there is arguing that in 1987 EVERYONE knew about Climate Change and was discussing it so Watterson wasn't ahead of his time at all.

Finally, I agree with your points that Calvin and Mom don't actually say many of the things I said... but as with any great literature, what is left unsaid and implied and the idea that specific situation is representative of the rest of the world's POV is what makes great literature great... even in 2019 what was said in 1987 still applies perfectly is a mark of a great cartoon."

Even the people who were concerned didn't have the kind of info we have today about what a few degrees change actually meant, or a realistic idea of how fast it was going to get here. Keep in mind that what actually happened since then tends to be the ""worst case scenario"" of the climate models of the time."

If you cared to expand on this statement at all, I'd be interested in your views.
It seems temporally obvious that the *modern* science of climate is only a handful of decades old — we could date its inception from the beginning of the Keeling Curve database, for instance. 

But I wonder what other scientific milestones might illustrate that point even more clearly. Maybe you have some views on that."
,"You are obviously up on the history.  I was in high school back then, and was just relating what I recalled about trends in enviornmentalism so that people who were not alive then would know someone at a teen thought about these issues back then.  I had no idea of IPCC in 1988, only Greenhouse Effect, as is stated in the cartoon.  The rest of my story is true, that I saw that everything was a catastrophe and that has made me cautious of such claims.

An anecdotal story is all it was regarding the original post, which was about a calvin and hobbs cartoon.  I am attacking no ones beliefs here and providing no facts."
,Why do you say he is “obviously” a troll.

,">It seems temporally obvious that the modern science of climate is only a handful of decades old 

It's not 'temporally' obvious, it's definitionally obvious, as ""modern"" anything implies recent."
,"I work with data from ESA Earth Observation Satellites.  I can tell you that there are about 100,000 variables when it comes to climate, and that Numerical Weather Predition does some pretty cool stuff, but honestly, from my Physics and Geology background, we are just scratching the suface.  So many unanswered questions, and that is why both NASA and ESA are spending so much money on Earth Observation, because quite frankly, like many things, the further you get into it, the more complex it becomes.

While I am cirtain that CO2 plays a role in the warming, I think this is far more complex than the political narrative of ""reduce CO2, all problems go away"", and it is far more likely that there is a number of things working in concert, and we have no idea how much Nature is helping or hurting the situation.

I am getting a feeling from the scientists here that ever since Geoengineering was taken seriously, they are reflecting a bit on the narrative they have allowed to continue in the public.  ""If this is a catastrophe in 20 years, and since there is no political will to solve the CO2 problem in that time frame, we should shoot aerosols into the atmosphere, right?  I mean we are all gonna die anyway!  Gotta try something!""

And thier response has been ""Well maybe we overstated the severity of the problem ...  lets not do anything rash."" 

Anyhow, I just came to reddit recently, and since I was noticing this very minor backpedaling to a more cautious stance, I was wondering how the public felt about things."

I don't think anyone's actually been claiming all problems go away.

Closest I can see is reducing CO2 allows us to avoid the worst projected scenarios."
,"This is super, *super*-interesting to me, thanks. 

>both NASA and ESA are spending so much money on Earth Observation, because quite frankly, like many things, the further you get into it, the more complex it becomes

If you ever decide to expand even further on this matter, let me know and I'd still be interested to read your thoughts. 

>I am getting a feeling from the scientists here that ever since Geoengineering was taken seriously, they are reflecting a bit on the narrative they have allowed to continue in the public. 

*Very* interesting observation.

>I was wondering how the public felt about things.

In the US, I don't think the idea of CO2 reduction as a panacea has gained much traction among the general public. My sense is that most people here conclude, mostly accurately, that they have little connection to or influence over the global climate and global anthropogenic trends. But in other countries, with smaller or more easily-swayed populations, views could be very different. 

This forum isn't a good representation of any sort of public audience, though. The forum takes a pretty laissez-faire attitude toward troll-like contributions, so it's up to each individual participant to filter out trolls to their own satisfaction, or else find another solution. I encourage you not to be put off by that here, though — there are still plenty of people who are genuinely interested in the actual facts and analysis in climate science. I've learned a tremendous amount myself. 

This is just a personal interest of mine, but it seems to me that while the oceans are monitored reasonably well today from above (I mean aerially and from orbit), surface monitoring still has huge improvements to make in the coming decades. Care to express an opinion on that?"
,"And here is where as scientists we have really failed the public.

Questioning is the basis to science.  And having heretic labels like ""climate change denier"" sounds like you are wrapped up in some sort of wacky cult. 

Science is settled?  No need to research anymore!   Your understanding of science is either disingenuine or you dont understand that science is about hypothesis generation and then finding ways to DISPROVE your theory.  We are doing far more climate change related missions in the space industry then ever before.

With profit motivation I was refering to the space industry, which is certainly linked to the wellness of the economy.

The predictions are mainly driven by activists and politicians (with some exceptions).  The rest of us fully understand its alot of guesswork at this point.   Long term models are hardly accurate at this stage in our understanding of climate science."
,"Even in the science community here, the models are known to be inherently unpredictable in the long term.   The best we can do is talk in generalities of ""likely"" and ""unlikely"".  And there are as many theories as there are scientists.  Most of those theories do not end in disaster, but those aren't nearly as fun to publish in the public realm, nor do they generate money for these missions.  Us in the space industry know full well that if things start to go bad economically, space is one of the first things cut.  We have to keep our relavence high.  

I am not joking about that.  That is strategic.

While at work I usually am using math and physics, the geologist in me thinks that a likely scenario could be that while there will be more weather, and this could endanger unprotected costal cities, other parts of the world will green.  Granted, these are places like the Middle East, Africa, and the Western US, so we arent as concerned.  But it is unlikely to me that food or food production ever be in danger.

Anyhow, while I am sure that I could spend hours talking about this stuff, we discuss it at work daily, and I think I need to give my brain a rest.  I am always interested in hearing what people think though, so don't be afraid to let me know what you think."
,"Is there any reason to believe things will be fine if we do not take drastic action now?

Shouldn't we apply caution and a big safety margin since we have no other planet to go to if we screw up here?"
,">And here is where as scientists we have really failed the public.  
>  
>Questioning is the basis to science

Oh please.

This isn't scientific questioning, it's not even skepticism. The fact is that the planet is warming rapidly right now, and CO2 is the primary and near-entire cause. This is widely accepted, and backed up by multiple lines of evidence among several branches of science."
,"The space industry has traditionally been one of the most stable sectors of the economy due to the government financing and contracts. Anyone who has worked in the industry (myself included) knows that. It is however a common trope to push the profit motivations among trolls. 

Is the science still developing around climate change? Absolutely. The data and modeling coming in as far more dire in a more rapid timescale then what was planned for even a couple years ago. Is the need for immediate and unequivocal action questionable? No. The science is settled."
,">While at work I usually am using math and physics, the geologist in me thinks that a likely scenario could be that while there will be more weather, and this could endanger unprotected costal cities, other parts of the world will green.  Granted, these are places like the Middle East, Africa, and the Western US, so we arent as concerned.

Bro, I am sorry to break it to you but this shows that you don't know what you are talking about. Are you suggesting as a geologist you think more C02 in the atmosphere equals greening?"
,">And there are as many theories as there are scientists.  Most of those theories do not end in disaster, but those aren't nearly as fun to publish in the public realm, nor do they generate money for these missions.

This seems made up.

>While at work I usually am using math and physics, the geologist in me  thinks that a likely scenario could be that while there will be more  weather, and this could endanger unprotected costal cities, other parts  of the world will green.

So you've assumed away published models and studies because there are other ones you're assuming are less catastrophic that don't get published, and then you posit that climate change will be a net neutral (or close to it) because of your experience as a geologist.

Why on earth would you do that?"
,"Ok, well, here are my opinions about the current state of affairs:

* A warmer climate will have more weather, which in general affects costal cities and areas prone to flooding.  Some countries, like the Netherlands, who are used to dealing with water, are already taking measures to beef up their dikes, etc.  
* A warmer climate will have sea level rise, the amounts which are debateable, but here I would plan for the worst estimates.  This is a very real agreeable consequence of a warmer climate.
* A warmer climate is a wetter climate, not a dryer climate.  Places like the Middle East, Africa, and the Western US, will receive more fresh water.  However, people don't really seem to care about these areas, so this is usually considered a minor point.
* I do not believe, having been raised on a farm and having knowledge of advanced agriculture, that our food supply will ever be in jeapordy with a warmer climate.
* Going ""Carbon Neutral"" is a non solution, since people and governments lack the will to do what it takes.  While there is popular support for these initiatives in Europe, I do not think they understand what each person will have to give up to achieve this.  And I certainly think that Americans do not have the popular support.  Nor will India or China do more than give this lip service.  
* So to me, when people say ""We should play it safe"", I think geoengineering is the only solution.  Any one country can do it, you dont have to rely on any other countries support (of course another country may use force to stop you).  Reflective aerosols in my opinion would be the easiest and best choice.  Mind you, I am not advocating for this, I am just saying that if the political will can be generated that actually wants to take concrete measures to drop global temperatures, areosols would be immediately effective and do not require world concensus to deploy.
* Nor do we have the will to switch to nuclear energy, which would go a long ways towards solving global warming.  We DO understand nuclear, the risks and benefits FAR better than we understand climate science.  Ergo, the fear of climate change must be less than the fear of nuclear power, which to me is irrational if you do even a cursory study of nuclear power and why it has gotten such bad press.

Again, simply opinions, I will not cite sources.  If you do not agree with me, feel free to respond, I am here mainly to see what the public believes about climate science currently."
,"I would encourage you to never stop questioning, study the science, and always be willing to engage in debate over ideas.  Do not let journalists or politicians think for you.

I can tell you that at least in space industry in Europe that deals with climate change, there is certainly no lock step march about climate science.  We all basically agree that the earth is warming, but after that, there is as many ideas about why and outcomes as there are scientists.

Please think for yourself.  Do not be worried about those who think the earth is flat."
,"No such thing as settled science.  I directly work with Numerical Weather Predicition and I can tell you that the modeling is far from accurate, however, we are getting better at it.  As well we are sending up numerous missions to better understand climate science, we are barely scratching the surface as to what we know about it.

I agree, the need for action is certain.  I am just concerned that we do not fully understand the problem, and that CO2, while likely a factor, is probably not the sole culprit.  As I have stated elsewhere, there are 100,000 variables that we deal with.

Also, as I have elsewhere stated (I will let you find it in my posts) that I doubt that the political will to do what is necessary exists.

While we live in current trend of increasing space budgets, space took major hits after the moon landing for instance, and in the US that budget has fallen every year since (as a % of Federal Budget).   
 Europe is all over the place and we have to worry about things like Georeturn (making sure that every member country gets its contribution back).  And there are those that question our need to have a space industry with more pressing problems on Earth.  Also, I would argue that regardless of the actual amounts being spent on space, those working in the industry (in Europe anyways) are always concerned."
,"First of all, as I have stated above, saying anything like ""more CO2 = something something something"" is highly simplistic and just not the truth.  The correlation between CO2 and temp is not well understood and obviously there are other factors at play.

I think people confuse warmer temps with dryer conditions, I do not think that will be the case.  I think it will be warmer temps with wetter conditions."
,"Whoa!  Easy there!  Nowhere above did I make any scientific conclusions.  I am giving purely anecdotal evidence.  I was just giving my impressions of the scientific community that I work with, as I percieve it, and my speculative version of climate change outcome.  I can guarantee you, that very few people will be correct about any of the details in the long run, and it is likely that I will be wrong as well.

I am not here to debate climate change.  I am an unbiased scientist who works on one very small detailed peice of the puzzle, but chats with other scientists about thier work.  I do not want to change anyone's mind, in fact, I am here just to observe what people outside my community think."
,"It sounds like you are a meteorologist. This has historically been one of the largest group of climate deniers/questioners. The best explanation I have seen is that meteorologists give too much importance to outlier data. The IPCC reports are clear on the multi-pronged approach that will be required to tackle this problem, no one in the field of mitigation think it is as simple as dropping CO2 emissions at this point."
,"I hold graduate degrees in both physics and geoscience.  I am a remote sensing specialist.  I create simulated test data for instruments that will be deployed on future Earth Observation missions that will be used to study various things related to climate change such as geolocation validation and ice cloud formation.

I do not recall seeing this ""multi-pronged"" approach in the IPCC reports, other than multipule ways to reduce CO2.  I do not see strategies to reduce water vapor, methane, or CFCs.  I also do not see any desire to find processes that might be exacerbating warming.  The new report coming out might spend some time talking about geoengineering techniques, unfortunately, that might be where we are now as far as mitigation."

“Prove us wrong.  Explain one scientific idea relating to climate change in your own words”

That’s not how it works.  You need to first show that the hypothesis of Anthropogenic global warming is valid.  This is done through repeated and verified experimentation and direct observation, not through anecdotal and circumstantial evidence that is then worked backwards through computer models designed to show CO2 is causing warming.  You need to show that a rainstorm or hurricane or flood or drought would have been less severe or not happened at all if not for human emitted CO2.    

Show me how empirical evidence ether supports AGW.  Show me the independently verified experiments that confirm AGW.  Show me the direct observations confirming AGW.

The fire has already burned down 1.5 million hectares (3.7m acres). Thats absolutely insane. Theoratically you could say the lungs of the earth are slowly getting burned away.
The Russian goverment was not willing to do anything about it because it would've costed too much money. Right now other countries are supplying locals with aid, and pressuring Russia to do more about it. Trust me, you'd be crying if you saw these comments denying the fires, just after your city(and possibly family) got scorched.

,"Yeah true but more than half of the global emission is chinese, a quarter is the US and the rest is south america europe and africa."
,"Sure, I will share what I know for France, I will just share the sectors I personally know  but I know for a fact Germany is following a very similar course. 

Construction: check out RT 2021 (which is a big ass 100 document pdf which see the legislation for new buildings) which just came out this year and forces the whole industry to change drastically all of It's construction methods. (Switch from conqurete frame houses to wood one, made it mandatory for all new construction projects to be energy positive. That makes it very hard to use conqurete as conqurete emit a lot of CO2, so new constructions will favor wood. Here are a few exemples. One in germany. [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/xVssUUUukywQkdsR6)

One in France [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/wPZA28v6UB5zHXuq9)

Architects in France and Germany (again not sure for other countries) now have to present a carbon a summary of carbon emission generated by the materials and the construction. The whole project has to be neutral or positive in order to be approved which forces a global change in the industry. 

Automotive: All european car manufacturer have a very very strict maximum emmision when designing new cars. If it is anything above set treshhold they pay around 80euros per Mg of extra CO2. That is massive and pushed some companies out of europe. ( Like Opel and most american companies ) That would rise the prices of the cars by 100% of It's value in many cases. If the new car has an electric version then it is deduced from the pollution allowed for the car using a certain ratio. Up to now this ratio has been ridiculousy high. (Like 1 electric car would compensate for 5 thermal one, but it gave time for the industry to switch ) but the EU is slowly reducing the ratio and pushing the industry toward electric.

You can find it in this pdf that I cannot share here but that you can easily google

Even if we were to stop all GHG emissions right now, those gases will remain in our atmosphere for decades and continue to heat our planet. It would take nearly a hundred years to get where we are now, and that's if we halted all emissions at this very moment.

We are just 0.3 Celcius away from 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average, which is what the IPCC predicted for 2040. These slow progressions towards net-zero may be ultimately too late.  

Forgive me for being a ""doomer"" but how can I look at this situation with any sort of hope? Any sort of promise? Most developed countries are nowhere near reaching their energy transition promises. Plus we can hardly tell the worlds largest GHG emitter to leave the south China sea and stop putting Muslims in concentration camps. How in the sweet fuck are we going to tell them to stop the numerous industries that have just started to form a middle class and 1st world comforts there. Even so, as long as we continue to buy their products our emissions will just shift over from where we live to China just like it's been doing for the past 20 years. Besides, most targets set by industrial nations are just for energy emissions alone. What about transportation emissions? What about animal farming? What about this insatiable need for bigger, better, and faster products? We cannot continue living as developed nations do especially considering most nations can barley transition into mass clean energy. We are unsustainably raping the planet to live a life of luxury that's slowly killing us. Our need for constant quick and convenient products emits an insane amount of emissions. In 2017, Amazon package deliveries ALONE emitted 19 million metric tonnes of carbon.

And say for some magical reason that human-caused climate change didn't exist, what about the total exhaustion of planetary resources? Constant progress isn't finite and is unattainable. 

No one likes to hear this, but except a full-fledged collapse of industrial civilization in the next 20 to 50 years.

,"China is trying to raise their standard of living to match the other industrial countries. Right now the US, Australia, and Canada each emit over twice the CO2 per capita as China. The industrialized countries are basically saying they have already emitted 50% of the total additional CO2 in the atmosphere in order to raise their standard of living but they want China, which has a lower standard of living, to lower their per capita emissions even lower after emitting only about 12% of the total additional CO2 in the atmosphere. I completely understand that all countries need to decrease the CO2 being emitted. I’m just pointing out the problem that China has."
,Saying the whole of the EU is changing their industry is a bit or a sweeping generalisation isn't it?

,Peruse around on the sub I linked earlier. I don't have the answers off the top of my head at the moment.
,"Well, its either I spend my days worrying about what will come, or I can try to prepare and just focus on the day to day. Focusing solely on the pessimistic all the time is exhausting, and mentally unhealthy for me to do. Doing what I can on a personal level, and just getting ready to face the future when it gets here. I've been exaclty where you are now, only just five-ish years ago. 

I know that next couple of years are gonna be, uh, jazzy. But sitting there and shitting myself about what might come isn't going to do anything. I've made the decision to enjoy the time that I have now, and prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. 

As I have stated in another post, the worst and best outcomes are ruled out to not be likely to occur. Does that make me completely unworried about the future? No. But I also know that even in a much warmer world humans will be able to pull through somehow, it is what we're best at. If we don't, well then I'll be too dead to care. 

Your anxieties are aboslutely valid. I just think we have to find a solution because we *need to*, and if we don't, see the above sentance. I don't know if you saw the above link, but again I will reinforce browsing /r/climateactionplan. The weekly dicussions have created a good catalogue of reasons why you can be at least a little optimistic about things. If you go through and read them you will likely see me voicing my anxieties in those threads, so its not as though I am blindly optimistic about the future."
,why are you booing him hes right
,Thanks!
,But earth does not care about that. It just care that CO2 is emmited. Also the co2 per capita thing is true only because a big part of China is dirt poor. The developed chinese cities consume much more CO2 per capita than the european one. The problem is there you see? As people get richer the CO2 emission will skyrocket.
,Amen. At least the younger generations are on the right track with this.

>Also the co2 per capita thing is true only because a big part of China is dirt poor. The developed chinese cities consume much more CO2 per capita than the european one. The problem is there you see?

All countries have the same issue of the poor emitting less CO2 than the rich. Do you have evidence that the different per capita CO2 emissions between the rich and poor in China is worse that other countries by any significant amount?"

If you are not convinced It is ok. It is your point of view which I respect. 

On another topic,  I suggest checking out this link [here](https://earth.nullschool.net/) from time to time. 

You can see the COV and particulates in the air in real time. If you decrease the particle size you will notice at some points that the desert areas become completely void of particles. It mean you chose à particle size small enough not to consider dust a particle. You will notice that most cities in the world tend to be yellowish (scale goes from white to red in real time ) 
You will then notice that the whole east coast if China is really really red. ( of course not all the time. )
But as a general trend it seem to be the case. 
Some cities in india and america tend to be red too. 
Even though this does not stricly pickup CO2 it is a good indicator of where the pollution is."
,"It was a simple question and there's far more to be pessimistic about the optimistic. Most of the ""optimistic"" stuff is how wind, solar whatever is cheaper than whatever gas oil but somehow, we're nowhere near weaning ourselves off fossil fuels? Funny that"
,"Very interesting link. I did not mean to say or imply you were wrong about the CO2 emission by the rich in China. I simply was asking for evidence that supports that statement.   
  
I can see where a visual on a map of the East Coast of China would indicate heavy CO2 emissions. But unless the visual is based on a per capita basis, it doesn’t give that information. Before the per capita emissions can be determined the amount of the emissions as well as the number of people doing the emissions must be known.  
  
In addition I would assume not every individual on the East Coast of China is wealthy."
,"How exactly rich cities in China pollute more than rich cities in Europe,  when the latter live on industrial production of the former? Unless you factor in the footprint of imports, its easy to point fingers."
,"Im with you man. I have absolutely zero hope in world governments to do the right thing in time. We are already seeing devastating effects. Once these problems become cataclysmic and apocalyptic, maybe then I can see world governments doing something tangible, but by then the amount of warming locked in and the natural climate feedback loops will mean its essentially pointless.

Even if for some magical reason human-caused climate change didn't exist, we have to remember that the resources we are utilizing to live the way we do aren't infinite and will eventually run out. In fact, [an MIT study](https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/z3xw3x/new-research-vindicates-1972-mit-prediction-that-society-will-collapse-soon) predicted this very thing in 1972, and using data from today numerous researches have concluded we're right on track. From what I can gather it has nothing to do with climate change and everything to do with finite resources running out

Buckle up bro. Make yourself a plan it's gonna get crazy"
Costa Rica will run on more than 98% renewable energy for fifth consecutive year,
,"Doesn't matter if it's a little bit of good news, any good news is still good."
,"> In 2019, Costa Rica has generated 67.5% of its energy from hydropower, 17% from wind, 13.5% from geothermal sources and 0.84% ​​from biomass and solar panels. The remaining 1.16% corresponds to backup plants, Casa Presidencial says. 

> The numbers do not include the fossil-fuel dependent transportation sector, which is responsible for 66% of hydrocarbon consumption and 54% of carbon dioxide emissions in Costa Rica.

So the title is wrong. 98% of electricity, not of energy is renewable."
,"The fortune of having lots of rain, the appropriate land relief, and many active volcanoes.

The same happens in Quebec (Canada) and Iceland.

Just want to point that Costa Rica has very little solar and wind on their energy mix. They can do renewable because they are very lucky."
,"Why isn't it a 100%? It can't be that hard to replace the last two percent right? 


Not criticizing just wondering"
,"What's their gCO2e/kWh, storage included of course ? That should be the main figure to headline."
,Viva Costa Rica!
,"News like this is a big part of what gives me hope. These countries and islands that are proving all the nay-sayers wrong - proving that sustainability *is* possible and affordable. 

At the same time they are bumping into whatever design and practicality issues are popping up, and their best minds are going to/or have started working on these problems, pushing science and infrastructure forward. When the rest of the world stops dragging their feet, there is already a model or even a collection of models to study and base our new utility grids on. 

I wonder if the feeling I get is the same as when telephone lines first went up and people stated owning phones? The future is here! :D"
,My guess is that they still use fossils to catch spikes in energy demand.
,"> there is already a model or even a collection of models to study and base our new utility grids on.

To temper your optimism a touch, Costa Rica’s achievement is due in very large part to its unique geography, which has provided the relatively small nation with relatively large amounts of hydropower.  They have been clever in using that hydropower as cheap ‘storage’ for wind and solar generated electricity (by using excess to pump water into the reservoirs), but few nations - and particularly lager nations - will have the necessary geography and thus hydropower resources to replicate their achievement.  

Chile might be one nation that can though, and right now they are planning to try.  Construction of large amounts of hydropower is not without its detractors though, so we’ll see if it is politically possible."
,"That sounds reasonable, thanks!"
,"I could imagine it being used in my home region then, lots of hills for solar or wind, and the elevated areas could be used to pump water up to man-built lakes, and let down to produce power like some of these islands are doing. Better yet, the lakes might help wildlife by supplying drinking water at least. I realize this might not be an options depending on how these facilities are designed of course. 

On flat land, couldn't communities use water tower type systems similarly until there is better technology?"
,"> On flat land, couldn't communities use water tower type systems similarly until there is better technology?

It comes down to cost.  Conventional hydropower builds a relatively small dam in order to create a relatively large water storage volume (which is usually filled 'for free' courtesy of precipitation over an even larger area).  Water towers can't compete.  Even conventional batteries are cheaper, and they aren't particularly cheap.  There are some promising cost estimates for a type of battery called a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery .  Some areas can use old mines to store compressed air - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed-air_energy_storage .  This is a really active area of research."
,"Oh that is freakin' cool! I had not heard of compressed air energy storage yet.

So quick, potentially stupid question. I'm writing a sci-fi with some emerging technologies and some... parallel but often incomparable technologies from another species, mostly focused on low-detection. Would air compression be a reasonable form of underwater propulsion? Or would all the bubbles potentially cause too much turbulence for stealthy maneuvering? I'm thinking fairly deep ocean areas here, but still on the continental shelf.

,My question too.
,"It was made by Simon Evans, with data from Global Carbon Project IIRC."
,"Actually, it's about lowering carbon pollution, not recycling.  The UK govt can also put pressure on China.  On the other hand, China gets it.  They lead the world in solar and have a much lower per person carbon pollution profile than the UK.  They have much to lose with global warming and don't have to deal with uneducated voters being influenced by oil money."
,">Especially when you consider that a lot of China and India's growth is a result of Western countries outsourcing their manufacturing

China will still feel the effects of the CO2 it emits no matter who the final consumer is. Given they are the worlds largest manufacturing economy and by a huge distance the largest consumer of coal, they can take their share of the blame for the current slow action on cutting CO2 emissions. "
,"In term of impact to the climate, yes, but I think its important for climate policy to see the per capita version"
,Where on earth do you get your information from?
,I did not.  It's from Twitter.  I've seen all time release graphs on there as well.  See @carboncount
,"You look at ice samples I guess. If we can do it for 100 million years ago, it's not far fetched to use it for more recent times. Don't quote me on that though."
,"It certainly cannot escape the share of the blame. The point, is, however, that per citizen, a Westerner will have a much, much higher proportion than even these graphs show. "
,"Per capita emissions aren't something to be ignored, but they're ultimately still political measures confined by arbitrary borders that the earth doesn't care about one bit.  

Volume is still ultimately the thing that kills the planet.  The top-3 emitters in China, USA, and India still account for nearly half of worldwide emissions.  If they don't get onside, it probably isn't going to matter what anybody else does.  Sheer momentum of mass.

Even if we're not going to take arbitrary political boundaries into account in climate destruction, it's still raw volume that matters.  Where the top 3 emitters still make up the same general areas of high population concentration.

Frankly, if we throw that out, it ends up looking worse by ""region"", because you start lumping Hong Kong and Taiwan (which are top emitters in their own right) in with a ""roughly geographic China region"" that is already exponentially more polluting than anyone else on earth, to form an even more potent ""super emitter region"", even though they're tiny geographic regions being added.

It's where i think harmful emissions per square km (or emissions density essentially) is a really useful measure, that has to be considered alongside ""per capita"" figures.

They both need to be reduced.  But which figure and by how much is possible, is more relevant, and is pretty geographically distinctive."
,"Surely you're joking. The data is freely available. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita

Sort by the most recent year."
,"Really?

China has a higher per capita emissions rate than many major developed world countries like France, the UK  and Italy. It is not that much lower than export and manufacturing giant and coal crazy Germany. "
Australia? Nope. Auckland NZ at 5pm in the summer (should still be sunny but the street lights are in) with Australias smoke clouds 😣 our ecosystems are all connected.,

We just feel so bad for the Australians suffering through this with seemingly little and slow action from their Govt. Their Govt still denying it is related in any way to Climate Change must be like adding insult to injury."
,Same here. My brother in Christchurch also couldn't seen the sun through the smoke new year's day and that's the eastcoast. And they can fully Smell the smoke. 😣 Definitely NZ gov will have to consider what to do
,Id say about as far as texas from california
,"I'm a NZer in Christchurch. There are a lot of deniers here too because any time theres a story linking climate change and events such as bushfires people get VERY defensive despite scientific research coming out and being published. It's so tragic to see what's happening to our neighbours, and seeing that haze made it so much more real. It was a sombre start to 2020 :("
,Nah that’s only about 1500 miles.. we can agree on California to Georgia though if you would like
,I redid the math. Its from inner california to inner Louisiana. But youd never see smoke from California that far like you are seeing in New Zealand due to mountains and valleys whereas over an ocean smoke can just keep travelling.
We Are Not Freaking Out Enough About Climate Change,Yeah... It's all fine. 🫣
,"I find it troubling that the lead author of the paper has apparently only looked at how often degree Celsius figures were mentioned in the IPCC report. It doesn't take that much knowledge to understand that the IPCC tends to prefer its scenarios (formerly called [Representative Concentration Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway), and now called [Shared Socioeconomic Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways)) to make projections.

To show why this difference matters, I decided to Ctrl-F [the IPCC February report on the impacts of climate change](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_FullReport.pdf) (the most relevant one, since we are talking about how bad it's going to get here, while the first report is basically about the processes causing climate change and the third is how to stop it/adapt to it) to see how often it mentions both degrees of warming and the SSP scenarios across its 3675 pages.

First, the degree search.

* 1.5^(o) C - 17 times
* 2^(o) C - 25 times
* 2.5^(o) C - once
* 3^(o) C - 13 times
* 4^(o) C - 9 times
* 5^(o) C - 2 times

So, it does seem like there's the focus on the best case, right?

Now, let's look at how often it mentions the scenarios.

* SSP1-1.9 - the 1.5 degrees pathway.
* SSP1-2.6 - the \~1.8/well under 2 C pathway. This pathway and the SSP1-1.9 are altogether mentioned 134 times.
* SSP2-4.5 - ~2.7 degrees. The ""intermediate"" pathway. [The one believed to be happening right now](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/). Mentioned 59 times.
* SSP3-7.0 - The pathway which leads to \~4 degrees. The pathway of the highest population growth and the lowest international cooperation. Mentioned 84 times.
* SSP5-8.5 - The hottest pathway, which results in 4.5+ degrees of warming by the end of the century, driven by the absolute highest economic growth. Mentioned 133 times.

So, the pathway of the greatest warming - one considered to be well *above* the most likely present course - is mentioned **more** often than any other pathway, and as often as the two lowest-warming pathways combined. This doesn't exactly scream ""underexplored"" or ""betting on the best case"" to me. I didn't see the lead author or his co-authors discuss this anywhere.

It does not help that in [the actual paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2108146119), the scenarios *are* mentioned at one point, but there's seemingly some confusion. SSP3-7.0 is first called a ""middle-of-the-road"" scenario (which is actually SSP2-4.5), and only later it is described more appropriately as ""a medium-high scenario of emissions and population growth"".

EDIT: I was wondering if the lead author happened to have a reddit account, but instead I found this thread when searching for his name (Luke Kemp).

They're also found in the boardrooms of that handful of energy companies that are doing everything in their power to keep the earth addicted to their fossil fuels.

1 and 5 can be more-or-less dismissed outright (essentially an ideal picture of harmonious global development and a suicidal high-pollution rush requiring more fossil fuels [than what may actually exist](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41247-016-0013-9)), so it leaves the other three in the middle, with 2 as the most plausible one still.

This paper below contains a lot of numbers and graphs about what 2050 under 2-4.5 would be like.

However, it is **not** peer-reviewed, and so it allows itself a number of dramatic flourishes. The most notable one is the food security section, which is premised on the idea of global cropland staying constant. In practice, no pathway assumes that: all but SSP1 estimate that the most likely way in which the stresses of climate change on food production will be dealt with is through hundreds of millions of hectares of forest [getting cut down and turned to cropland](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959378016300681-gr4.jpg). As such, the peer-reviewed studies project impacts on food security that are a lot more modest than what you might expect from reading the Chatham House report alone.

Of course, this would inevitably devastate the environment in those places, and this is the key reason why so many species (one million out of eight as the base-case estimate of IPBES; other major groups have estimates closer to 1 species out of 5 or even 3) are projected to be at risk of extinction. So, that is the likely future by 2040-2050. The climate gets unquestionably worse and more disruptive for everybody, but hundreds of millions nevertheless go from extreme poverty to something more like their countries' middle class, and their and our lives are sustained through further encroachment onto the once-undegraded land. Later in the century, this arrangement could come under severe strain if we both fail to electrify farming machinery to any meaningful extent and if oil availability goes down as much as some analyses [show it might](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666049022000524), but the uncertainties here make this more of a speculative scenario for now. (Even many of the scientists warning us that the future unfolding in this manner would be ""ghastly"" are [still skeptical](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2020.615419/full) that we would see a genuine population decline beyond what might be expected from falling birth rates in this century.)"
,"No, and this is not my argument, and nor is it the argument I'm responding to. The primary claim advanced by the paper cited in the article is that the worst outcomes of climate change are insufficiently **studied**, and it explicitly claims that the 1.5 and 2 degree worlds are mentioned too often in the scientific literature relative to their likelihood, and there is not enough mention of higher warming.

My little exercise shows that on the contrary, the scenario widely understood to lead to over 4 degrees of warming (SSP5-8.5, formerly RCP 8.5) is mentioned as often as the scenarios associated with both of those figures combined, so this particular claim appears groundless. Indeed, there are plenty of papers which *only* look at the RCP 8.5, and some of them admit that there has not been sufficient research into the other scenarios to enable them to study those as well. i.e.

[https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10274](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10274)

>We then used best fit air and water models to predict frequencies of summerkills based on modeled air and water temperature estimates for the mid- and late-21st century (2041–2059; 2081–2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 — **the worst-case climate scenario and only scenario with water temperature projections across our study region**

Or

>Data are taken from the Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive, compiled at the National Center for Atmospheric Research from simulations run at modeling centers around the world (7). **All of these ensembles were created using the “high-emissions” Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)**, and four of these models made the appropriate land surface variables available: the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model version 3 (GFDL-CM3), the Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2), and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark 3.6 (CSIRO Mk-3.6) (Materials and Methods).  
>  
>**The choice of the RCP8.5 high-emissions scenario for this study was necessitated by data availability, since all available SMILEs employed this scenario in their experimental design. We note, however, that RCP8.5 is regarded by some as an overestimate of projected future warming** (17) and a lower-emissions scenario will project a less extreme set of future changes. Nonetheless, these ensembles represent one of the best available experimental suites to assess the potential range of future hydroclimate changes, and the complete sets of simulations used, including ensemble sizes, are described in SI Appendix, Table S1.

So, these studies provide further proof that RCP 8.5 is often the most-studied scenario, and yet it is often considered an overestimate. Indeed, as I said earlier, the current projections of most likely temperature by the end of the century place it [at \~2.7 degrees](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/), which is well below RCP 8.5 and is almost exactly the same level as RCP 4.5 So, if anything, it is the RCP 4.5 (now SSP2-4.5) that is badly understudied, and  the authors' claim appears groundless.

The other claim made in the paper, that there's not enough attention paid to non-linear interactions, etc. between different impacts of climate change appears more plausible on its surface. However, it's hard to trust it entirely after they chose to lead their paper with what appears to be a rather dubious assertion."

,"1.5t of co2 emissions is the budget of a single person allowed. No Western civilization is even close keeping that budget. Online discussions love to put the responsibility on China and India to not exceed the budget since they emit the most. However, the average co2 emissions of an Indian person is only 1.8t and is therefore close to the allowed average. Chinese citizens emit now 7.4t per capita. Still half of what the US citizens emit: 15.2t."
,Computers were at the point where crude climate models could be run in the 70s. Although there was no consensus from climate scientists at that point it was starting to become a possible concern. But in the 90s a consensus was developing that this was a major problem. That was 20-30 years ago.

,"I really don't like looking at nation numbers and comparing them like that. It makes it too easy to shift responsibility away. There's always someone else who is a worse offender by some statistic and this is used to justify not having to change a thing. 

For instance: in German debates (i am German), it's often said ""Germany is only contributing 2% of global co2 emissions, what could we do if we change our behavior?"" My answer on that: ""we're only 1% of the world population but contribute 2% of emissions! Don't you see how that is wrong?""

But usually, people really don't want to hear that, because it does what they don't want to hear: it makes them personally responsible. Talking about personal emissions:

> this means that every person on this earth would be entitled to a climate-friendly budget of about 1.5 t CO₂ per year on average in order to reach the maximum warming target of 1.5° C

Source: https://www.atmosfair.de/en/green_travel/annual_climate_budget/

What does this mean? 

A flight from Paris to New York and back: 1.9t co2.

What about cars? 

> A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. 

Source: https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle

I guess it's pretty obvious what that means...

Our life style is unsustainable in the long run, unless we change the emissions drastically. How? Travel by train for instance. The co2 emissions from Berlin to Paris by train: 0.005t. By plane: 0.195t. When pointing that out to people, they'll say ""but taking the train sucks, it's taking so much longer!"". Is that so? Taking the train from Berlin to Paris takes about 9h. The plane takes 6h. Sure win? Well, the train arrives at the center of the city. The plane does not. Getting from the city center to and back, the airports surely adds another 1h. Also, you need to arrive somewhat earlier at the air port for security checks - add another 30 minutes to be sure. So for the fucking convenience of not having to change trains and saving 1.5h - 2h of our time, we deliberately choose to emit 39 times the amount of co2. What. The. Fuck. This is what is wrong with us. 

I actively try to minimize my footprint. I don't have a car and don't fly much (once every 5 years maybe). And what do people tell me when I say I arrive by train? ""Why don't you fly, it's so much more convenient"". I hate this so much. We're in this boat together, but no one wants to pick up the paddles and do their part. Even worse: when someone wants to do their part, others try to convince that person that this isn't necessary!"
,"USA isn't the #1 contributor by either total emissions or by per capita. Your friend is right.  The USA industrialized much earlier (and in a bigger way) than other individual nations, so the US has more long term cumulative emissions than other nations.  When we're compared with, say, Germany or France or England, nations with the populations analogous to several of our states, our size dwarfs theirs.  When compared with nations late to industrialization, like China or Brazil or India, our early adoption caused us to have more cumulative emissions.  

So, pick and choose which way you want to measure things, and declare carefully before you make claims.  

We are aspiring to have a 50% reduction in emissions (based on 2005 numbers) within the next decade or two.  That would cause our per capita numbers to swap places with China (since they are still growing, and have said that they intend to continue to increase emissions).  With 5 times the population as the US, it won't take long for them to catch up, and be the #1 nation in cumulative emissions, with the US a distant second.

But, yeah, USA bad, or somethign."

Why do we outsource manufacturing, anyway?  Because it's cheaper to have something made outside the US and shipped in.  Why?  Lots of reasons, but among the reasons are a) labor costs, b) the costs of regulatory oversight, c) the costs of environmental protection enforcement.

I believe it environmental protection.  I believe in having a safe workplace.  I believe in having a living wage.  When we allow nations like China to produce goods for us with low cost labor, with no worker protections and no environmental protection, we get ""importing from China - with CO2 emissions counting as Chinese emissions.""

Border crossing CO2 based tariffs would help fix that - and would also massively raise the cost of Chinese made items, making it more palatable for US based companies to make their items in the US.  Until it's no longer a lot cheaper for us to buy things from China than make them ourselves, the situation will not change."

,"Ok, listen, every, single, degree matters in ways that you cannot begin to imagine. A single increase in that digit could mean the absolute collapse of entire ecosystems.
I have no idea how to even begin to describe the absolute hell that would unleash if that gauge increased by no more than two digits. Global warming isn’t just warming, it’s the destabilization of natural phenomenons. A single digit of warming means not just a hotter climate, it means dry air, stronger winds, less rain. Basically every single phenomenon gets amplified. Wet areas get wetter, dry areas get dryer. This is a chain of reaction. So when that gauge reads one degree of escalation, that means several digits more of temperature in one place, dryer air, less rain, and so on. If a single mf drops a cigarette in a forest, or someone drops a glass of beer on the ground (that will make the soil burn), the plant will be so dry that the fire is basically unstoppable.

Unfortunately, it's  worse than the lack of accountability. The bigger issue here is that all decisions are distributed: a consumer of bio-fuel cannot know (and, likely, would not care even if he knew) that much about environmental impacts of producing the bio-fuel..

One potential improvement would be to outright prohibit exports/import of biofuel (or at least any such exports/imports should not be labeled as green and should not be eligible for any subsidies). The idea is that both consumers and producers must be in the same jurisdiction and subject to the same laws to expose any environmental costs

,"The situation isn’t quite as bad as you’re making it sound though. Yeah we’ve destroyed a lot of primary forest and ruined many areas, but the planet’s pretty big and there’s still a lot of forested area left. Scientists distinguish between natural forest and plantations: 93% of current forest area is natural, 7% is plantations. The rate of deforestation has decreased since 1990. Some places probably do have more forest cover today than they did in the early 1900s – even though there’s a lot to still do, we’ve come a long way in terms of environmental protection and understanding of environmental economics, forestry, etc. since then. Other places obviously have way less forest cover now than in the early 1900s. Also for the record, biodiversity exists outside of forests too – not saying you’re claiming it doesn’t, but just want to point that out since there’s a tendency to equate nature with forests/trees even though that’s just one type of ecosystem. It’s just not all so black and white all the time.

,"As cool as this is it probably isn’t as great as it sounds. The land still needs to be ferilised and prepared with minerals, ect needed to grow trees. The soil also needs to be able to retain moisture and be soft/hard enough to sustain plant life. Great idea but it really only solving one piece of the puzzle"

,"At first read, I thought you were asking if the planted trees might out-compete local species. 

They could be adding fertilisers and growth hormones. Or planting genetically modified plants that are more resilient. It wasn't clarified in the article."
,"Maybe the ‘missiles’ have fertilizer and the drones target areas with good access to water?

Edit: after more reading, the 'missiles' are seed pods with fertilizer that are fired into the ground using compressed air, and they do indeed use the drones to gather soil data to ensure optimal placement of the seeds.  They are approximately 100 times faster than planting by hand, and much, much cheaper, although each drone is worth about $100k."
,"Exactly my thoughts. Thanks for asking.

Something is missing there with the 'forced' plantation drive. I see it no different from over-consuming. Some natural processes can't be forced, and should not be. It can not sustain in longer term, natural process will take over.

Perhaps it can sustain until we plant enough trees to offset the ones that were lost due to rapid deforestation."
,"They mention stats though, they were able to plant 4million trees in 6years,and plans to plant 2 million more with the drones. Unless by “trees"" they mean they are counting the number if seed they tossed in the ground and not actual saplings"

,Hemp can't grow everywhere and is only a native species to various regions. It's far more effective to grow trees that are native to each region.
,"I've heard hemp proposed before. But I'm not clear on what you do with it when it's mature. Cut it down and make stuff from it? We already do that with cotton. Within a few years, it'll be in the dump, rotting away releasing it's carbon. Trees will be there for a long time with deep roots."
,Sounds plausible. But I don't know if there's any way to verify a theory like that.
,"I dont mean to be rude but this seems like such a dumb point to make by you and the OP. It's like saying, 'I dont get why we plant wheat, natural processes would be much better at spreading wheat seeds and planting itself! We shouldn't do it, it can't be forced""

Uhh yeah it can and CLEARLY our little nudge and management helps growth hugely. Not every evolved being is optimal or perfect at what it does, that's why evolution works."
,"By trees they could easily just mean planting seeds. Saplings aren’t even a great counter, as plants can die of diseases, lack of nutrients or water well into the growing process due to poor soil.
That why farming takes more than just putting seeds in, and if we say are planting trees in grass dominated biomes chances are the soil wouldn’t be the greatest."
,"Plus it sounds incredibly wasteful. It’s like using rockets to transport goods. Why use small drones that can only carry so much and can be inaccurate than using an automated tractor of some sort, or just hand plating it."
,"The thing is it requires about 1/3 the amount of water to plant hemp than cotton and for making paper u can get 3-4x more cellulose from hemp than trees per acre. Hemp also has the capacity to clean absorb chemicals and toxins from the air, water, and soil in a process called phytoremediation. Not only that but the cotton industry alone is responsible for 26% of the world’s pesticides while hemp does not require much. Hemp can absorb more carbon in a year(3 crop rotations) than a tree can developing its maximum carbon storage which takes 12 years for some trees.  Yes trees are great but when it comes to humans consuming, hemp is at least 100x more sustainable because of the 50,000+ uses it can have."
,"It's not as hard as it may first appear. Take pine trees. We can estimate the number of cones they produce each year, the number of nuts within each one, and count the adult trees in a stand and the number of new trees."
,"Beyond a point - even 'force' planting wheat is can not sustain. 

I clarified both sides - it can be useful for now, as we have a deficit to cover. But only until certain point, or certain duration. 

It is not a replacement for change in behaviour/attitude towards nature. In fact, a desperation to speed up tree plantation using drones - is a sign that we approaching the stage very soon."
,Yea could be a fake article then.. But i do want to believe that its real though.
,"Yes, hemp is great in many ways. I'm just questioning whether it is effective as a carbon sink. If you are harvesting it and then putting that carbon back in the air almost right away (ie within a couple years) or simply replacing cotton or paper with hemp, I don't see how it could be. I would love to be wrong on this though. We need solutions. But we can't afford to be wrong"
,"Aren't you overthinking this? It's simple isn't it? We need to plant trees because we cut them down faster than the natural process allows them to recover. We will always have a deficit to cover because humanity and our lifestyle and basic needs dictate that we take, take, and take from nature. Technological advancements such as these are simply ways of ""giving back"" before we are at such a desperate stage that even seed planting via a drone gatling gun will not suffice. It's a simple demand and supply equation."
,"I agree. Technically yes because if we use hemp as a main paper/wood source, which would be nearly impossible because of paper companies and their solid foundations into the american system, it would technically help as a carbon sink because we are cutting down trees 3x the rate at which they grow so not cutting trees down would definitely help. So technically it’s like the two plants are working together to store the most carbon and provide us with resources"

Yea no. All the kinetic transfer does is move the energy around within the planet, while the entire basis of the greenhouse effect is about the reduction in radiation leaving to space. You seem to think that Stefan said that conduction and convection somehow prevent radiation, still think that energy transfer can only ever be one direction at a time, and somehow think that anything that confuses you is sophistry.

,"You've demonstrated a genuinely bad ability to understand basic concepts, like 1-1. But I'll leave you with some of the paper, just so that I know you read it:

>The change of El Niño onset regime around the late 1970s is statistically significant. Table 3 shows a 2-way table for testing the statistical significance of the changes of the frequency of occurrence of the 3 types of El Niño before and after the late 1970s. The χ2 test indicates that the regime shift around 1978 is significant at the 99.9% confidence level.

>What has caused the observed change of El Niño regimes? It has been recognized that decadal variations of the background state may have profound impacts on ENSO behavior (17⇓–19). Fig. 4 shows the equatorial background-state changes. The equatorial western Pacific has experienced a significant warming trend coincident with global warming (Fig. 4A) but the central-EP has not. As such, the equatorial zonal SST gradient around the dateline, defined by SSTA (5°S–5°N,135°E–165°E) minus SSTA (5°S–5°N,165°W–135°W), has been enhanced since 1980. Consistent with the increased westward SST gradient, the easterly trade winds near the dateline (150°E–150°W) have also strengthened and the thermocline has shallowed in the past 4 decades with the largest shoaling occurring in the NINO 3.4 (120°W–170°W) region (Fig. 4B), which results from the enhanced easterlies in the CP and the basin-wide wind anomalies (20). This thermocline shoaling together with surface layer warming has substantially increased the vertical temperature gradients (upper-ocean stratification) across the equatorial Pacific.

>These changes in the background conditions over the past 4 decades are arguably favorable for the occurrence of MCP and SBW El Niño events. First, the warming in the western Pacific increases the zonal SST gradients across the dateline, and thus enhances the zonal advective feedback process, which is conducive to El Niño being initiated in the NINO 4 (160°E–150°W) region. This explains why MCP and SBW events tend to occur coincidently and predominantly after the late 1970s. To support this argument, we show, in Fig. 5, that the observed NINO4 SSTA during the El Niño onset phase (April through August) indeed increases with the increasing mean-state zonal SSTA gradient measured by SSTA (5°S–5°N, 135°E–165°E) minus SSTA (5°S–5°N, 135°W–165°W) with a significant correlation coefficient r = 0.85 (P < 0.01). To a large extent, the explanation here is also consistent with the results obtained from coupled climate model experiments (21), in which an initial warming in the western Pacific is associated with strong zonal gradients of mean SST and trade winds in the equatorial CP. Second, the western Pacific warming provides favorable conditions for the Madden–Julian Oscillation (22) events to move into the western Pacific more frequently (23), increasing the frequency of WWBs and thereby the probability of occurrence of SBW events. In addition, the increased vertical temperature gradients strengthen the thermocline feedback, favoring occurrence of SBW events."

How limited is your thinking? Really? It's well known the tropopause is the radiating relevant part, that's basic IPCC science. You just don't understand the experiment Stefan describes in his paper. You deny conduction&convection play a role, the relevant part of (kinetic) heat transfer.

> movement of heat from a warm body to a cooler one

Gases are not solid bodies and a miserable conductor, especially when convecting. It's a dynamic system and gases have properties.

>You deny what Stefan describes

Nope, only correcting your misconception. He points out that there are multiple modes of heat transfer. He never said that only one can be active at one time, nor did he say that flow in one direction prevents flow in another. In fact, as I've pointed out to you multiple times, he uses the difference between the two directions to calculate the net flow, which you deny he can do. I've even given links to online textbooks that point out that heat is the net flow, but you still deny it.

>depends on the emitter

Nope, energy transfer is bi-directional. Period. Since nothing is at absolute zero, any object will always be transferring energy away from it. But since other things are transferring as well, the total amount depends on the difference between the two. But this is something that's above your ability to comprehend, apparently, since you continue to reject it.

,"Planting more trees might not be the answer. They will just make forest fires bigger and less easy to put out as we see in Australia.

Also... And I think this is important; The effect of this would be gone after a few decades because of the CO2 we're still putting out there. It would merely POSTPONE the effects.

,"No!!! More trees = less bushfires.  One of the excarbating factors is the amount of deforestation in Australia.  On the east coast you get lots of rain from our coastal waters, inland, however, tree respiration is vital to providing atmospheric moisture to allow rain on the western side of those ranges.

Massive deforestation as well as the lack of water (the mismanagement of our rivers is insane) have massively decreased the amount of trees providing that humidity.

Ausralia needs to immediately restore our rivers, replant trees and stop selling coal.

It's a mess to be honest but there IS a huge change of sentiment occuring.  One of our most profilic right-wing shock jocks who has been desperately trying to blame our greens party for the fires has today admitted global warming is real.

,"I don't believe the article's point is that planting trees is useless or not welcome, but rather that the study's claim that ""(...) reaching this maximum restoration potential would reduce a considerable proportion of the global anthropogenic carbon burden (~300 GtC) to date"" is erroneous or at the very least a bit optimistic. Reforestation has many benefits but it cannot be an alternative to emission reduction.

,"Planting trees is like a bandaid for a ruptured vein. You can wrap something around it, but eventually you need to suture it (or whatever the medical procedure is). 

In this analogy, if you suture the vein, you stop CO2 from coming into the system (You're climate Neutral, which is our goal). Though some people even deny the ruptured vein exists, so you won't go to a doctor (peer pressure/democracy). They will probably only be convinced when they slip in the blood, but you keep soaking it up.

So it MIGHT be preferable to wait doing something about the bloodloss just till everyone is convinced we need a doctor.

After that we can fix the bloodloss by planting a lot of trees.

,"Yeah look on a point of semantics I’ll walk back my language for you there. But in reality nuclear waste is a very small overblown issue in an otherwise very good energy source. 

By scalable I refer to the fact that there is a point of diminishing return in building solar and wind farms due to how much space the have to take up to produce the same energy as a nuclear plant, how their location can be difficult to pick, that they cannot provide constant or predictable energy to the grid, that in order use them reliably for power, we’d have to strip mine all of South America for lithium to make enough batteries. Solar and wind are amazing sources of energy when the area permits and the provision of energy from them meets grid demands.

We do however have current tech that we can employ today that can power our entire grid, on demand day and night to bridge us until we get there."

,"Carbon taxation is widely regarded as the most efficient and cheap way to combat climate change as it outsources the problem to the market.

The idea that overpopulation is a problem by itself seriously needs to die. Growth rates are falling every year with something like half the countries in the world experiencing fertility rates below 2. We've already reached peak child population. We just need to reach the point where these have all grown elderly and the global population will enter decline. The most cited estimate I've seen is that we'll peak at 11 billion people before the decline. We're almost at 8 billion already.

Now that doesn't help the acute problem that is climate change, but it's not nearly as big of a problem as we think it is. The biggest problem, by far, is that the average person on Earth has kept increasing emissions until the plateau we possibly hit in 2012 and are still on. We need this to turn downwards, and this needs to happen quickly. Carbon taxation is probably our best solution to that."
,Thanks
,"Doesn't seem like a very well controlled study and besides internet unavailability in some countries, limitations are not specified. What steps were taken to avoid non-compliance? Since it is an online survey, there shouldn't be any reason for there to be unaccounted answers.

,I believe climate changes. I don't believe we're all about to die as a result. That's what the data and reputable scientists say. The point is that there is not a consensus on the issue.

You won't do that because you don't really believe in your cause as much as you claim. You are a religious nut who wants to force his religion upon all non believers. Sounds like a fascist to me.
,Because it is not supported by actual data. The more educated the individual the less belief in envireligionism.

,"Exactly. Unfortunately even in countries where humans are not facing immediate issues, there is a mass extinction going on in nature. For example, Scandinavian countries have seen local bird species population going into a steep decline in a just few decades. The ""hidden"" effect on ecosystems is the really scary part. Once that becomes apparrent, is there anything that can be done?"
,"Are you living close to the pole? Most of the population in Scandinavia is in southern part of the countries. Is water running out like in Indian cities? Change in average temperatures is bigger, but change in actual living standards lower than in countries that are closer to the equator. If Scandinavia moves closer to being temperate, the climate for humans is still temperate as opposed to areas where smaller changes cause severe droughts and heat waves.

I am not saying the effects are not alarming. I'm saying people's perception of the changes is different."
,"Nah what he's saying is correct... The thing is a heatwave in Scandinavian countries means things might get up to 35celcius.   People turn on their air conditioning or a fan. It lasts a week or so and it goes back to cooler Temps. You can still get through it. 



In india a heat wave lasts weeks, can be 50 celcius and people don't have A/C and die. 

So yeah India feels the pain more than Scandinavian countries."
,"I know Scandinavia is just as vulnerable - but I meant people's perception of the climate change. We see the effects already, but we do not see as many negative effects. Yet.

Yes, we are all fucked. Together."
,"We are literally not frozen most of the year. Start of thermal winter is moving from October to November, and spring is starting earlier.

From human point of view +10 would mean winter months would be completely dark because of the lack of snow. We would have just rain and darkness. Most people here prefer the snow for a good reason. 

It is of course pointless to speculate what +10 degrees would mean, as that would mean global climate would have gone through unimaginable changes. Ecosystems adapt even slower."
,Indonesia and Malaysia have significant oil reserves on Borneo...
,"That probably says something about the groups you're in. 

 I'm not much for anecdote-based fear-based decision making.  The handful of anti-vaxxers I've met were not people I could have a comfortable conversation with, much less want to follow on social media.  Surely they feel the same about me.  Meanwhile, my friend group easily discusses the potential logical fallacies of climate alarmism and a few are in denial.  We are natural skeptics of things we haven't personally witnessed

That said, we only have one planet and it's beyond me how any rational person wouldn't think it's good insurance to be over-protective of it."
,Thanks!
,"Well, I think that also affects US numbers since an online survey is skewed against including those over 70 many of whom get their ""news"" from reich wing TV. The US numbers of people who do not believe in climate change should probably be a couple of points higher, at least for another decade or so."
,So what doesn't fit the narrative is garbage?
,"I agree but that is one of the causes. This is anecdotal but, India had a drought in 2018 and this year it received the 3rd highest rainfall in history. What can explain this?

If you believe in your cause so much get together with other religious believers and donate 100% of your incomes to what you say you believe in. Exactly no one is preventing you people from doing that just like no one is preventing people from donating to their church. You won't do that because you don't really believe in your cause. You just want to force anyone who disagrees with you to also give up their money for something you claim to believe in. You are trying to force your religion upon everyone.

,"Here's a take from a friend of mine who works for the EPA. The ruling is narrower and not as bad as they were fearing.

""The first 10 pages cover the majority opinion. 

My take - Read narrowly, EPA still has authority to regulate carbon emissions from stationary sources, just not on a systemwide basis under existing CAA law. This translates into a political poisoned chalice to regulate power plants with Maximum Achievable Control Technology, such as carbon-capture, regardless of cost. 

Otherwise, I think carbon disclosure, social cost of carbon, and interstate carbon markets are still intact. 

Only a hot-take from incomplete reading of the full opinion."""

> The current Court is textualist only when being so suits it. When that method would frustrate broader goals, special canons like the 'major questions doctrine' magically appear as get out-of-text-free cards.

Is the European heat wave due to climate change?,
,"Before I elaborate, I just want to say that I recently completed a PhD in atmospheric science, and I have several peer reviewed papers on climate related topics. I also work at a lab that develops climate models. 

No climate scientist will disagree that climate change is affecting the _frequency_ of heat extremes. It certainly is. However, you are asking if climate change is affecting a very particular weather event, which is an entirely different question. What climate change is doing to particular weather events is often poorly communicated to the public, in my opinion, due to the challenge of explaining probability in a simple way. I attempt to explain what I mean below, with an analogy...

Imagine you are tossing two coins. When flipping one of the coins, there is a 50-50 chance it lands heads (as should be the case). However, imagine that the other coin is weighted so that there is a 80% chance it goes heads. Both coins can land tails or heads, but the weighted coin will land 80% more often as heads than as tails. So, if you flip both coins _one_ time, there is no way you can tell which coin is the weighted coin. In order to tell which coin is weighted towards heads, many consecutive flips are required.

How is the story above relevant to climate change? Similar to how a single coin toss isn't able to discern which coin is weighted and which is not, a single weather event is not easily attributable to climate change. Furthermore, similar to how many consecutive coin tosses will tell you which coin is weighted and which is not, an entire season or year of weather events may be able to tell you if climate change is occurring. 

In spite of what I wrote above, there are groups doing ""rapid attribution"" studies to try and quantify the impact of climate change on single weather events. It is somewhat debatable, but arguably has merit because we do have physical equations that dictate the evolution of weather. Personally, I am not comfortable with rapid attribution because, try as you might to remove climate change from a weather model, it's not really certain if the sequence of events triggering the weather would have occurred in the same way. How weather evolves is dictated by a set of highly nonlinear differential equations.

There's a lot more on heat waves that I can share here if interested. There's also a podcast series that interviews climate scientists (deep-convection.org). It's rather unfriendly for the general public, honestly, but there are some interesting interviews that touch on questions such as this."
,"Because of climate change these sort of events (i.e. heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires etc) are happening with higher frequency and increased intensity."
,Theres climate and there is weather.
,"We don't know for sure yet, but we will soon enough. 

We do know that the European heatwave from three years ago ""would have had extremely small odds in the absence of human-induced climate change, and equivalently frequent events would have been 1.5 °C to 3 °C colder.""

https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba3d4

Same goes for last year's North American heatwave. Only five other heatwaves since 1960 were as bad *in terms of deviation from the mean temperature* - so if the mean temperature did not go up, it would never have been as bad.

https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/

https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm6860

I get the nuance of what you are saying and appreciate your elucidation but that subtlety, particularly for the general public, is one factor in the continual and too successful downplaying of the problem by those who oppose any attempt at mitigation. To most untrained people it reads as prevarication and uncertainty. The practical reality is that there is near 100% consensus within the scientific community that climate change is the defining factor in these recent events whether they are floods, droughts or fires. That’s what needs to be communicated. If I ask the obverse question “Would it be over 40°C in England (for example) WITHOUT the influence of climate change?” the answer, outside of a strictly scientific context, must, to a high degree of certainty, be a clear “NO”.  The current European heatwave is as bad as it is because of climate change. That’s what people need to be told so we generate the social will to address the crisis."
,"You sound like you know what you’re talking about. So what is physically causing a heat wave vs. “normal” weather patterns? Like, is it simply a case of the jet stream is stalled out in a more equatorial zone so its bringing warm air, and if it could move to the northern/southern latitudes we’d see things cool off?

I guess what I mean is, last summer I asked what was driving Canada’s heat wave and all I got was “climate change”, end if story, when what I wanted to understand was what is physically/atmospherically happening to cause the heat wave?"
,"Nice comment. It’s slightly unfortunate that I now start reading these educational replies, scroll to the bottom to make sure it’s not going to turn into an Undertaker wrestling story, and then go back up to read through."

,"So it's  ""unlikely that it isn't due to climate change""?"
,"IPCC AR6  (2021): “…In the UK, the lengths of short heat waves have increased since the 1970s, while the lengths of long heat waves (over 10 days) have decreased over some stations in the southeast of England (Sanderson et al., 2017b)…”"
,"IPCC AR6 (2021): “…While various studies have described increasing trends in several heat wave metrics  4(HWD, HWA, EHF, etc.) in different regions (e.g., Bandyopadhyay et al., 2016; Cowan et al., 2014; Sanderson et al., 2017), few recent studies have explicitly attributed these changes to causes…”"

,"Great analogy, with the two coins.  The general population doesn't have much mathematical understanding, but everyone has played with coins and dice."
,u/bananas1224 piggybacking off the extreme heat waves...how would you suggest we tackle the water shortage issues that'll ensue?
,"I’m curious what you think about sites like https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/ that attempt to quickly generate odds of an extreme weather event to help people talk about it in real time (like, instead of waiting for peer review? Thanks for your comment."
,So you’re framing it from the perspective of probability of an event - how about the intensity of climate events?  Is that more easily directly attributable to climate change?
,"Not pretending that I have a better understanding of climate change, but I feel that I need to put things right when it comes to cause and effect, since nobody else does that here. By the way, I really like the analogy of the coins, it is a great way of thinking about how a single event cannot confirm or falsify a pattern of chances.
Climate, however, is an aggregate of weather over a longer period, so as such, a change in climate can never cause a weather event. It is the other way around: many weather events contribute to the climate. As an analogy, in the western world, people have become taller over the last century. Now, this height change did not cause me being taller than both my parents, but me being taller than my parents did contribute to the general height change. It is probably the better and more varied food that made me taller, as it did to so many other people of my generation, which manifested itself in a general height change. Note that there are also some people who are smaller than their parents, but they don't negate the general trend towards taller people, nor the presumption that better and more varied food causes height change over the generations.
So, the question is whether the cause of the climate change, which has to be CO2 emission and all that, is also the cause of the current heat wave. Now here is where the analogy with the coins would fit. 
It is the same sort of question whether a long time smoker got his lung cancer from his smoking habits. You can't be sure for a single case, but in a group of smokers lung cancer is way more frequent than in a group of non-smokers. You might then think that the event has been caused for an x % by whatever caused the change in the normal pattern."
,"I've been trying to clear up some confusion regarding the application of the terms heat wave and heat dome. It seems like people like throwing around heat dome as a term to describe an extreme heat wave, but from what I've read, it sounds like a heat dome is just the atmospheric setup which causes heat waves, correct?

Also, are all heat waves associated with a heat dome?"
,Sounds like a shill for big coin flip.

,"I would argue that nothing has drastically changed in your/our lifetime other than the way the media covers climate issues (note the term “drastically”). Climate change is generally a very slow-moving thing. Obviously the climate seems to be changing more rapidly now than it would in the absence of human activity.

I would also say that we can definitely and probably will “fix” this in our lifetimes, and it’s not unlikely that various technologies will continue to be developed that help to stabilize the climate (carbon capture and storage with/without bioenergy production, etc.). Additionally, giving a better world to the next generation would obviously be ideal, and people like to blame previous generations for climate change. They seem to forget that the past few generations have faced and overcome major threats (a third world war, nuclear war, etc.) to deliver us a much “better” (obviously not perfect, and at the end of the day it’s a bit subjective anyway) world than the one they inherited."

These cold outbreaks are paired with simultaneous warm outbreaks over the central North Pacific Ocean. I can elaborate on this in another post if there is interest..."
,"Hi!  
Thank you for explaining this beautifully. The analogy was really important to understand if climate change can be attributed to such extreme events.

The reverse relationship - changes in the Earth's core affecting air temperature - seems more plausible to me, given that the magnetic field prevents high energy solar winds from entering the Earth's atmosphere. But, I haven't encountered any studies that relate changes in the magnetic field to changes in climate (or vice-versa).

,"Happy cake day!

That question seems significantly more meaningful to ask than the ""was this event caused by climate change"". Are there more examples where we're asking the wrong questions, statistically or otherwise?"
,"Nearly all heat waves are caused primarily by southerly flow bringing in warm air, like you said, in combination with decreased cloud cover. So, that heat wave in Canada, and the ongoing one in Europe, probably has these ingredients. Carbon dioxide by itself, directly through the greenhouse effect, causes probably 1-3 degrees C. The debate ongoing is whether carbon dioxide has changed the way the circulation moves in the atmosphere, such that persistent southerly flow bringing in warm air might + the accompanying sunlight might be an indirect consequence of carbon dioxide. It's a area of continuing research."
,"Purely from a statistics point of view, I couldn't say one way or the other without looking at more data. Looking at this whole year and seeing the vast number of heat waves, I would say that it's unlikely climate change did not play some role in these heat waves generally. (This is pretty much consensus). Overall it's tough to quantify the exactly how much climate change affects one individual weather event. 

From a physics point of view, however, I think it's justifiable to say that for any given day, warm or cold, the temperature is warmer than it would otherwise be if carbon dioxide and other GHGs were at preindustrial levels instead of 420 ppm. In other words, if the exact same weather systems were moving through Europe today, but the carbon dioxide was at preindustrial levels, it would probably be cooler by perhaps a few degrees Celsius. That's just the greenhouse effect... But this argument is sort-of nuanced by the fact that the weather systems themselves may be affected by climate change."
,What is the use of people like you to this world. Don't want to listen to explanations and educate others. Rather call everyone climate deniers because they didn't agree with you on everything.
,"Good point. So climate change is increasing both the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, as you pointed out. I guess my answer to your question is sometimes... Sometimes you get an event that is so intense that it may be easier to discern from just normal weather variability. It would be like rolling a 7 on a die, if that makes sense. Like a heat extreme with an intensity that has never been observed in the historical record. An analysis of the physical mechanisms driving the heat event is still a requirement to make a definitive conclusion.

,"According to the scientists who study global warming, the world will continue to warm if we continue to burn fossil fuels. Heatwaves like this one will become more frequent, until they become so common they no longer count as 'heatwaves'. Actual heatwaves will be yet hotter.

I understand that there's some nuance in that we don't have a great model of weather, and we can't attribute single events to a trend - but I don't think we waited to understand the biology behind how smoking affects your lungs to conclude that it does. 

On that note, I hope you don't mind a more specific revision of my question - Do we have any less reason to believe that climate change causes heat waves than we do when we say smoking causes lung disease?
(Given I can't find an RCT where they make one group start smoking, and the others not)

If you saw a chain smoker suffering from severe lung disease, nobody would blame you if you said ""yeah. Probably was because of the smoking""."

,"Yes, I would agree, but of course there will always be an annual cycle within that pattern.

The longer periods, like 10 years, start to provide a better basis for comparison,
So something like a 10-year moving average, would be a good short-term indicator.

Though note at 10-years, you start to pick up on the 11-year solar cycle.

In practice there are lots of different factors influencing things.

The overall pattern though is steady increasing in temperatures, along with rising CO2 concentrations."
,"Basically air rotates clockwise around high pressure and counterclockwise around low pressure due to the Coriolis effect balancing the pressure gradient force (this is called geostrophic balance). So when La Nina produces high pressure off the west coast of the US, the air rotates around it clockwise. Clockwise rotation around this high pressure leads to winds from the south over the central North Pacific, causing warming there, and winds from the north over western North America, causing cooling there (which includes Seattle). Wind from the north causes cooling because it's basically moving Arctic air into your location. Wind from the south causes warming because it's basically moving tropical air into your location.

High and low pressure centers are typically about 3000 km wide or thereabouts, and lows and highs move around the atmosphere all the time, usually west to east in the jet. That's really what causes day-to-day changes in weather. 

Basic idea; if wind is blowing from the south at one place, it's blowing from the north somewhere else, because air is just going to rotate around pressure systems."

I didn't say that this event has no connection to climate change. It's just that drawing the connection between the weather on June 17, 2022 to climate change is difficult. 

I also don't want to misunderstood as trying to downplay the importance of climate change. It's _extremely_ important. It requires action. I'merely just trying to provide my best to answer the question with scientific precision. 

I do appreciate arguments against including nuance in communicating climate change to the public. In my original post, I included a link to a podcast with climate scientists. How science is communicated to public is very often a topic of discussion, where some scientists agree that nuance is not appreciated enough, while others think that nuance prevents action. Maybe there can be another post to talk about this..."
,"Excellent question. Yes. If the mean temperature (50th percentile) is going to increase by 1C, you can expect the 95th percentile to increase by more than 1C. The temperature distribution is not just shifting uniformly. High percentiles are shifting more than low percentiles."
,"Climate change, without a shadow of a doubt, causes an increase in the _frequency_ of heat waves. This is absolutely true. And, this is similar to how smoking causes an increased probability of lung cancer. But saying climate change caused an increased frequency of heat waves is different than saying that climate change caused a particular heat wave on the date June 17, 2022. I will concede that some climate scientists will disagree with my perspective (the field is a bit split on how to deal with the issue of weather event attribution). I personally fall more in the camp that individual weather events shouldn't hastily be attributed to climate change. Perhaps detailed analysis can lead to a convincing argument, but it often followed by criticism.

I'm going to try to get you to think about this from a scientist's perspective. If you were to try and answer the question, did climate change cause the heat wave on June 17, 2022, how would you do it? If you are like me, you would start with a thought experiment. In order to figure out if climate change affected the weather on precisely the date June 17, 2022, you might consider a hypothetical scenario in which additional carbon dioxide and GHGs weren't emitted and the industrial revolution basically did not happen. An issue becomes evident pretty quickly upon playing out the thought experiment further,  if you have an understanding of the butterfly effect... If you didn't have the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is definitely the case that the weather on the date June 17, 2022 would be different than it was with the additional carbon dioxide, but weather is governed by an _extremely_ chaotic system of differential equations, so this is basically guaranteed. For example, you can also remove a butterfly from planet Earth today and the weather would also be entirely different a few weeks from now than it otherwise would have been if the butterfly were kept on planet Earth. Obviously butterflies aren't causing heat waves.

Because of the chaos in the Earth system, I find questions about how climate change is affecting individual weather events difficult to think about. It's overall difficult to address the question that is being asked in this thread. Some scientists are trying to do it, but the methods are really targeting a different approach, which instead of considering a world without the industrial revolution, is forced to think of the current world and closely examine the physics behind each individual weather event. 

As I said somewhere else in this thread, I think it's fair to say that any day, warm or cold, is warmer than it would otherwise be if carbon dioxide were at lower levels. Beyond this, it's just quite a bit tedious to figure out the exact relationship between the weather on June 17, 2022 and rising GHGs, because statistics can't be employed and considering a world without the industrial revolution is complicated, not that useful. It's much easier to look at the overall statistics. That's why I prefer to limit definitive conclusions to how the overall frequency has changed, rather than just one weather event, unless a very convincing physical argument is made. 

You may be interested in looking into ""rapid attribution"" if you'd like to read opinions that differ from mine."

,"Note that the original question was about how La Nina affects the weather in Seattle, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. I didn't mention the Southern Hemisphere because that wouldn't have been relevant to the original question, and I didn't want to generate confusion

You still make a good point though. For any people who still read this thread in the future, now they can learn that the direction of rotation in the Southern Hemisphere is opposite of that in the Northern Hemisphere. Air rotates clockwise around lows and counterclockwise around highs in the Southern Hemisphere and in the Northern Hemisphere air rotates counterclockwise around lows and clockwise around highs."
,"Some scientists hold the view that climate change is causing a preference for La Nina conditions, but most models show a slight trend toward the opposite state, El Nino. 

I wondered if the article would quote Richard Seager and it did. He published a somewhat controversial paper arguing that climate models are biased toward El Nino and that we can't trust El Nino/La Nina predictions from climate models. Overall, it's possible that climate change is creating a preference for La Nina, but it's not consensus. In fact, I think most scientists would argue there is more evidence against a La Nina preference due to climate change than evidence in support of a La Nina  preference due to climate change. 

Note that It is pretty common for La Nina events to happen two years in a row, but a third consecutive year is a little weird, and definitely rare. So the question your asking is warented... I don't think the La Nina is related to glacier runoff. Probably more related to changes in the 'walker circulation'. That's a very complex topic."

,"So still just fine, because CO2 and rising average temperature anomaly probably\* *cause* none of those things."
,"Nope. I'm not in Seattle. I asked because it affects my answer to your question.

In Seattle during winter, it's cold during sunny days and warm during cloudy days because when the wind is from the east, you move relatively warm air from the ocean onshore into Seattle. This makes it cloudy too, because air overlying ocean has a lot of water vapor in it, that condenses and forms clouds when encountering topography. Conversely when the wind is from the west, it will be sunny because the air is drier and has less water vapor. But air from the interior of the continent is colder. 

So basically in Seattle, it will be colder in winter when the wind is from the east, because that brings in air from the interior of the continent. But it will be warmer when the wind is from the west because that brings in air from over the ocean (which stays warm over winter). Air from the ocean makes clouds, so warm weather will be cloudy weather. This will be unique to Seattle and other west coast cities."
,"Yes, I am. Are you?"
,Thanks again. I’ll have to check out the walker circulation.
,"It already has, and is continuing to do so.

The be more specific - climate change increases the probability of these events, which increases their frequency of occurrence."
,Just a friendly FYI: you replied to yourself.
,See my above comment where I accidentally responded to myself lol
,">climate change increases the probability of these events

Maybe, but probably not. This statement is about as vague as it is useless; we don't yet have a truly empirical, verifiable, usable understanding of the climatic system. News agencies loves to sensationalise everything, understanding included- this is partly why so many people have such a shit grasp of statistical/scientific uncertainty."
,Oops lol
,"Yeah, that confused me."
,"No, current scientific opinion is that climate change is happening, and that it manifests itself as an increased probability of extreme weather events.

Now although that is vague, compared with a particular forecast for a particular location - which is often what people want to know, it is nonetheless an accurate statement."
,"Sorry about that... Two facts need to be understood in order to understand why sunny days are colder than cloudy days in Seattle during the winter.

1. It gets cloudy when the wind blows from the west, because a west wind brings in water-vapor rich air from over the ocean.
2. The ocean is warmer than the land during winter (due to high heat capacity of sea water).

Couple these two facts, when the wind is from the west, warm, wet air is pushed into Seattle, creating clouds and warming. On the flip side, when the wind is from the east, it brings in colder air, drier from the continent, which leads to fewer clouds but colder temperatures. Does that help??"
,"Meh, polled opinion is not science. It was once ""scientific opinion"" that the Earth was flat and that the Sun revolved around it.

I suppose I'm not saying it's *inaccurate* to claim ""climate change increases probability of X,"" I'm just saying it's uselessly vague to do so. It's a bit of a Russel's teapot.

The doctrinal pseudo-science of ""this is the established opinion and that's that and that's why you can't have a dirty smelly petrol car"" doth butter no parsnips."

,"Well, I am just paraphrasing the results of the climate scientists.

No if you don’t think that climate change  is a thing, then I am not going to bother trying to change your mind.

All I will say is that it’s now scientifically established fact."
,What's the most convincing repeatable lab experiment you've read of?
,Climate change science is not a lab experiment.
,"Ah well I'm afraid I usually need verified repeatable results from well conducted experiments to be convinced. More generally, what's convinced you? Is it a particular report, bit of modelling- or do you just accept what you're told?"
,"There have been lots of scientific studies on all different aspects, and they all point in the same direction - towards a warming world.

Considering this was first worked out in 1896, it really ought not to be controversial by this point."
,"So you need verified experiments to calculate the future positions of the planets over the next 50,000 years?"
,Bad bot.
,Don't you? It's not just guesswork...
,"The positions are not determined by experiments, they are determined by mathematical models."
,Crucially those models are verified by observation; i.e something like an experiment. A model is as good as the precision and accuracy of the predictions it provides for the outcome of feasible experiments/observations.

There has not been 50,000 years of observing the position of the planets.

And we observe global increases in temperature.

,"Well technically there has been millions of years of observation because as you look out into space you look further back in time. It's a consequence of the finite speed of light.

Also, planetary motion is much simpler mathematically than the thermodynamics of large climatic systems. Much fewer variables, lower stakes and more opportunities for making measurements- there are many different planetary/solar systems to observe in different stages of development. That said, when there are many many systems the calculations can get very complicated- like with galaxies; a sub-field in which there remains unanswered open questions (dark matter/quantised inertia etc).

With our climate, all we have is just Earth. As far as I'm aware there are no measurements of an increase in global temperature, but rather a trend upwards in something like localised temperature difference from average. IMO there's really not enough 1st hand data to comment with the same rigour as with planetary motion, so the idea politicians/media/activists pushing policy decisions on this ""science"" (which usually dresses up some underlying business/lobbying consideration) frustrates me.

As a Physicist I am fully of the opinion that the future is Nuclear and Hydrogen powered."

No, the planets are not light years away

>As far as I'm aware there are no measurements of an increase in global temperature

Sure there are, from both satellite and ground"
,"True *our* planets aren't light years away, but there are planetary and star systems that are. There are *other* solar systems in our galaxy.

With temperature measurements- they're just that. Gotta be a bit more a specific with increase; this is a comparative statement. If you measure over 6-12 months you'll simply see the seasonal temperature change, up or down depending on the time of year and location. The measurement of ""global temperature"" is limited by the variance across the globe, which is probably around 30 degrees or so. Much more than the sorts of temperature change target numbers activists and politicians harp on about."
,"> There are other solar systems in our galaxy.

We've only observed the motions of exoplanets for a couple of decades.  We can predict the positions  of planet's because of the laws of physics, e.g. Newton and Einstein.  Just like we can predict global warming using the laws of physics, e.g. Maxwell and Einstein.

>The measurement of ""global temperature"" is limited by the variance across the globe, which is probably around 30 degrees or so

The uncertainty in satellite temperature measurements of global air temperature is less than 0.1C"
,"My point here is I am a lot less convinced about the climate change modelling/prediction than similar work done in gravitation owing to the greater complexity of the climate.

There's variation in temperature across spatial location though, right? Like the air above the North pole isn't within 0.1° of the air above the equator. And I thought science was done in absolute units?"
,"There are different baseline temperatures, which is why the change in temperature is what is reported, for instance https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/

We also don't know the absolute position of the planets with regard to the center of mass of the universe"
,"≈ +0.2° per decade is \~ +0.1% per decade, so given the same (distributed?) temperature increase (from localised baseline) rate after 100 years that would be \~ +1%

I'd argue that you cannot know the absolute position of anything."
,"Yes, and the temperature with that 1% increase would be higher than anything in the last 800,000 years.  In addition, it doesn't magically stop with the 1% increase, in 200 years it would be even higher."
,"Your claim about the last 800,000 years categorically cannot be tested by experiment, and only compared to reconstructed data using methods that are also similarly unverified, no?"
,"The methods are verified, we have a much better observational record of temperature over the last 800,000 years than we do of the positions of the planets."
,"What does verifying a reconstructive method for testing temperature in the past look like? Surely they're much more limited than satellite constellations that can be exposed to a massive area very quickly.

How much ""better"" is this observational record? Charting of the planets and stars has been done for hundreds of years now, owing to work done on navigation at sea."
,"There are many proxies, and hundreds of papers discussing the uncertainty of these.

> Charting of the planets and stars has been done for hundreds of years 

Yes, but we can predict the positions for tens of thousands of years, not just a few hundred.  And prior to Newton and Einstein we couldn't."
,"Still all proxies though. And what does it matter if we see the highest temperature in 800,000 years? We have the most iPhones in circulation, and highest murder rate that's been seen in 800,000 years too. Doesn't mean iPhones cause murder."
,">And what does it matter if we see the highest temperature in 800,000 years

Because we are not well equipped to adapt to such temperature increases in many parts of the world,  agriculture has depended on a relatively stable climate for the last 10,000 years."
,"If we can breed chickens to grow 400% more quickly in decades, and genetically modify crops I reckon we've got it covered. Silver lining is that higher CO2 concentrations support better plant growth don't they. Greenhouse effect literally makes the atmosphere a greenhouse, which is good for plants."
,"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/19/new-study-undercuts-favorite-climate-myth-more-co2-is-good-for-plants

Not so much.  But at least we've gone from ""it's not warming"" to ""OK, it's warming, so what?"""
,"The Guardian is not a good source for scientific updates. Also, many crops are grown in greenhouses that elevate the temperature and CO2 level to boost growth for, y'now, more profitable results.

Also, no I've never said ""it's not warming,"" and neither am saying that *it* is."
,">The Guardian is not a good source for scientific updates

From the guy that thinks Koonin is 


> no I've never said ""it's not warming,"" and neither am saying that it is.

You stopped debating that point"
,"This isn't a debate; debate doesn't really have a place in science.

I'm personally still unconvinced either way; I've not yet had the time to delve into these satellite observation projects. It's easier to just ask people who seem to care. I read Koonin's book which I quite liked."
,"You stopped trying to say that temperature was not increasing and changed topic.

Koonin, hilarious https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-book-manages-to-get-climate-science-badly-wrong/"
,"So I never said ""temperature was not increasing."" Nor did I say anything close to it. I was criticising your ambiguity in the use of the term temperature, and the uselessness of vague statements.

Interestingly the article quotes many sections of the book, but doesn't actually refute any of them. It's as if the author of the article hasn't actually read the book:

>His teaser for Chapter 7 is an equally troubling misdirection. He promises to highlight “some points likely to surprise anyone who follows the news—for instance, that the global area burned by fires each year has declined by 25 percent since observations began in 1998.” Global statistics are meaningless in this context. Wildfires (if that is what he is talking about) are local events whose regional patterns of intensity and frequency fit well into risk-based calibrations because they are increasing in many locations. Take, for example, the 2020 experience. Record wildfires were seen across the western United States, Siberia, Indonesia and Australia (extending from 2019) to name a few major locations.

Koonin addresses this, talking about the impact of forest management being conflated with climate change as a driving force behind wildfire trends.

I'd say if the publication has to have ""scientific"" explicitly in the name, it probably isn't particularly scientific."
,"Finish reading:

>Take a more specific example. From August through October of 2020, California suffered through what became the largest wildfire in California history. It was accompanied by the third, fourth, fifth and sixth largest conflagrations in the state’s history; and all five of them were still burning on October 3. Their incredible intensity and coincidence can only be explained by the confluence of four climate change consequences that have been attributed to climate changes so far: record numbers of nighttime dry lightning strikes during a long and record-setting drought, a record-setting heat wave extending from July through August, a decade of bark-beetle infestation that killed 85 percent of the trees across enormous tracks of forests, and long-term warming that has extended the fire season by 75 days.

>So, what is the takeaway message? Regardless of what Koonin has written in his new book, the science is clear, and the consensus is incredibly wide. Scientists are generating and reporting data with more and more specificity about climate impacts and surrounding uncertainties all the time. This is particularly true with regard to the exaggerated natural, social and economic risks associated with climate extremes—the low-probability, high-consequence events that are such a vital part of effective risk management. This is not an unsettled state of affairs. It is living inside a moving picture of what is happening portrayed with sharper clarity and more detail with every new peer-reviewed paper."
,"""The consensus is incredibly wide,"" but not in agreement with the forestry commission themselves. This forest management argument is not unique to Koonin. There is a consensus on it; a policy of fire suppression has prevented smaller more frequent fires burning off light deadwood layers. Fires are part of a forests natural lifecycle, and always has been. Indeed I believe forest fire size and intensity are down in regions where this policy has been reversed.

I don't refute the idea that average higher temperatures, or a longer drought season have *also* contributed to your wildfire issue, but like Koonin says all of these things fall into natural variability and due to the short timespan of the observed behaviours it's important to be reserved in making grand conclusions.

The point of Koonin's book is that whilst a net increase in temperature anomaly is observed, the time period compared to the duration of cyclic climatic behaviour makes it very difficult to isolate the anthropogenic signal from the feedback loops  between CO2, aerosols, heat etc; that ultimately control temperature anomaly. Therefore drastic actions to reduce CO2 output at the expense of economic growth and working/lower class peoples' wellbeing are hasty, and attempts to understand how best to adapt are more suitable. What evidence contradicts this? Like actual papers or books written by hard sciences professors/researchers and whatnot, not cute popular ""science"" web articles.

You ask me to finish reading, when it's somewhat clear you've not read the book you're trying to criticise."
Nearly 70 percent of people in 14 countries say climate change is as big a threat as the spread of infectious disease.,
,There's no vaccine for climate change. People should be worried.
,"And what percentage of those will actually *do* something, if they think there's an issue?"
,"the comparison is ridiculous - one is a problem, that if completely ignored, will kill at most 1% mostly sick and elderly, the other has the potential to reduce the planets carrying capacity to a number that is so low that it implies a majority of people dying, not even including the side effects (basically all 4 riders of the apocalypse).

sadly, society reacts only to the smaller problem right now."
,"Is there evidence that climate change and zoonotic diseases have a common cause?

What does the evidence say is the common cause of both?  That common factor needs to be addressed in addition to directly tackling climate change. 

Perhaps human destruction and degradation of natural habitats is leading to mass species extinctions, climate change, and zoonotic infectious diseases.

Also, bear in mind, there are other, much more deadly viruses out there. MERS death rate around 35%. SARS 9.5%.

So far we've dodged a bullet. If the current virus were as deadly as either of those two... 

While Climate is the most urgent environmental issue to deal with, it is not, by any means, the only one."
,It's a way bigger threat actually.
,"I’m surprised that people don’t realize that infectious disease outbreaks is linked to overpopulation and climate change. 

We haven’t even begun to see how many novel diseases we are gonna get if climate change keep accelerating. 

Better get comfortable breathing through a mask."
,Climate change is 100 times worse than Covid for the human species
,"So which is it? Is climate change an emergency that’s going to wipe out civilisation, or is climate change as bad as infectious disease?"
,Bigger threat* i’m maskless at my job and everyones fine but we are keeping distance
,Anyone care to produce some number predictions on deaths due to climate change vs pandemic over time?
,"Covid's likely a fairly transient threat (we'll either get a vaccine or learn to mostly live with it), but climate change is going to affect everything, everywhere."
,"makes sense, those are both things that use fear to control you."
,"it's going to manifest in a similar pattern of noticeable occurrences to a pandemic virus where it will start out bad but seemingly isolated, and then, suddenly, your property is on fire/flooded/etc etc. 

I basically live outside the world as a result of seeing pure devastation after a long marine heatwave. We're not talking about sudden death, we're talking an exponential thinning of life.

Even in the 90's, it was like diving into life itself. There were no meaningful boundaries between individuals because the space between would be filled with increasingly smaller forms of life. It was like jumping into sunlight for me as a kid. I'd study the tidal pools and the smaller critters I could see with my microscope. I've tried to write it off as a memory embellished over time but I remember a different world entirely. One where a person had to learn to be careful of life or be stung by it. Now it's all rocks and bottom feeders and the water looks and feels dead. That space between that used to feel so full of life, feels like distant souls wandering in purgatory. Empty water between them. 

We're giving up and taking the one thing nature can't afford to lose; energetic continuity. There are no backups for a system that's worked perfectly for a million+ years and nothing adapts to conditions it hasn't been exposed to. The weaker links fail first, then the species they feed partially starves until it also goes. 

if a jenga tower could only ever be played once and then would cease to exist, would you continue to play after you realized your game would mean your next move could mean the potential end of the game's existence? I can't justify the cost and don't really see the benefit. Technology really isn't that great. We've traded quality for quantity and the second container shipping gets disrupted, we'll have 4 years before we're back to the stone age because everything will have broken.

Believe me, I hate it more than anyone. I lost myself in the emptiness of that ocean. Part of me is stuck down there, screaming into the void, realizing ""this is global"". I don't know what to do with that knowledge or pain. It's so much more than a personal loss, it's like watching someone take an eraser to the sky.

What we've already given up is completely inexcusable. What we're about to lose in a flash is everything else. Just like a virus, it wont be your problem, until it seems like it's only your problem. 

How anyone can participate in this doomsday machine I don't understand anymore. It's like picking slavery over freedom, in the instincts that are wasted in this world we built and torment us in the stasis of our surrounding (hence fashion). We miss nature and being surrounded by life. That's all we're supposed to be doing. That's all there's a budget for. Eating and fucking but nothing else, and especially not fossil fuel powered industry. No shit it advances technology and fast! it's literally concentrated time! We're burning time to get ahead. It's absurd. We're not actually accomplishing anything because we're spending 100k years worth of fuel to advance 100k years of tech but we have all those emissions, released over a decade, completely overwhelming the plants' and sun's ability to fix/absorb that extra carbon. The concentration of CO2 wouldn't be going up if plants were able to keep up. And what is ANY of this for? We eat terrible food, do menial jobs that make no sense or train robots to do the jobs that do make sense... We killed ourselves to rebuild a nature that couldn't hurt us because it wasn't alive, but we never realized that our fear of the dark and the wild wasn't from the wild, it was from us, and we brought it with us. All stuff is trash or will be trash at some point. We kill each other over trash, that we've killed the planet to ""have"" (either it breaks or you die, nothing is forever, so what the fuck are we collecting for? did anyone prepare for any of the climate issues we've had so far? Doesn't seem like something we're going to be good at preparing for so we should stop trying to buy for the end). 

I know there's no other way to feed all these people, but I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I want to spend what days there are left trying to help life where I can, and make amends for a species that forgot itself. Be there at the bedside of the ocean when the last of its infinite hearts stops beating and it becomes a meaningless chemical soup. Monstrous and horrifying existence our species has chosen, The only animal with the power to vocally appreciate the beauty of nature are the only ones threatening it with every move we make.

"Climate change is unimportant, is it? I live in NSW Australia. I feel every day like I'm living in an apocalypse film."," I live in NSW, Australia. We are on fire, and have been for weeks.

Today has been covered in smoke cloud. You can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. It looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. I look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. Not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. It has been for days. The afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.

Today was 39 degrees Celsius. The winds have picked up. The firefighters have been at it for over a month. Over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. Huge portions of it are now soot black. You look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. People have lost their lives. People have lost their homes. The devastation of wildlife is huge.

Sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. I watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. My one cat has asthma. I've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. Otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. It's week three of this.

We are in drought. Again. And it looks worse this time. There are parts of NSW where the dams are empty. Truly empty. Dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.

The sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as I try to get to sleep. People who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. I drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. I pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.

It's two weeks to Christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. Places I've been - places I know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. ""I wish you all the luck in the world"" is what I can say to those I know facing it, and what I get back is ""We will stand and defend our home.""

These aren't small fires that burn out in days. These are firegrounds larger than Sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. The hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. The result is a thunderstorm.

You'd think rain would put these fires out. It does not. The ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. The fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. We get floods on top of fires. Sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.

These thunderstorms are unlike any I have ever seen before. People say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. This is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. Early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. And it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. You just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.

Because these thunderstorms start new fires. They put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.

I've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether I'm needed to help evacuate people. I've watched places I know well go up in smoke. I've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like I have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place I live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.

And then there are the arsonists. I'm at a point where I'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. More water that we don't have spent on fighting them. Planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. All because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be ""funny"" or ""cool"".

Outside my window is sepia tones. It isn't usually. Usually it's blue, and an Australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. It seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.

I look at Wollemi National Park on Wikipedia. Only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. Home to Aboriginal heritage sites. Home to a great many things. An amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. Not a word about the fact that it is black.

Never before in my life have I been so tempted to edit a Wikipedia article as I was just to add the salient point: ""*it's on fire""*. There's little of it left. I tried to edit it. I had the sources I was going to cite with me. I don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.

""Climate change?"" they say. ""What climate change?""

I looked at Cape Town, South Africa and thought, ""Thank the fates we have it okay here!""

Now I look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. It's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. That all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen."
,"Our prime minister sat on reports from fire agencies warning of this for around 7 months. The ruling government's party in NSW, the same one leading the country, defunded emergency services to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The PM has no climate policy whatsoever other than denialism and pushing for increasing coal production. The home affairs minister, who has a creeping amount of worrying power, has suggested along with the PM banning climate protests.

Last couple of days, PM has refused to send extra emergency assistance to augment what is largely a volunteer base, and has said Australia's climate policy is ""getting the results it's supposed to"".

,"Vancouver BC here. We had a few straight summers of red suns, but this last summer we were relatively lucky. Makes me want to live more nomadically in the future."
,"I am curious if anyone here could explain the fire history in NSW. For the longest time people agressively put out fires in the united states. The last 2 decades tactics have been changing, but areas that we're preserved by fire fighting are starting to light up... When they do it's bad. The timing does not seem worse. We created these tinderboxes and now with higher average temps they seem to be getting that extra boost.

I'm just not sure what we should do. We could agressively start fighting fires again, but I wonder if that would only make things worse. Wildland firefighting is the front line of climate change and we only kind of know what we're doing.

Unrelated, the United States pays our fire fighters shit. They deserve more after having to risk their lives because the world couldn't get it's shit together. 

Good luck down there man. I was close to a giant fire in Manitoba 2 years back and it does look apocalyptic. I never realized why Vietnam movies always showed a blood red sun .... At least I didn't until I saw the sun obscured by wood smoke on a lake. Eventually the smoke will clear and I hope we can all pick up the pieces."

Yes yes I know fires are complicated and not necessarily an indication etc... If you step back and look at the bigger picture things are getting worse. Slowly but surely storms are getting stronger, fires are getting bigger and longer. Like the frog sitting in a pot of water heating up slowly things are getting worse overall and we are sitting around on our asses doing nothing and in some cases taking actions to speed it up.

,"This is generally a good post. Fires are a very complicated matter and not necessarily an outright indicator of impending climate change issues specifically.

I lived in a very fire-prone area; there were always fires but some years were particularly awful. Same stuff AUS was experiencing - I think there was about 1.5-2month long fire that made our entire valley feel like a choking chamber because some guy decided that, despite warnings not to, have a small controlled burn on an extremely dry and windy day. That’s it. When it was almost sniffed out, some dipshits in the area went camping and didn’t properly dampen their fire, which then further extended it and made it even worse.

Not contending that drier conditions and fires are a symptom, but they’re also a byproduct of grossly incompetent leadership (many fires in CA), gross incompetence by civilians (the record-setting in Gorge Fire in Oregon in 2016-2017), and of course natural phenomena in an already at-risk environment.

One more time for emphasis, this is from the National Parks Service in the US:

‘Nearly 85 percent* of wildland fires in the United States are caused by humans. Human-caused fires result from campfires left unattended, the burning of debris, equipment use and malfunctions, negligently discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson. Lightning is one of the two natural causes of fires.’

There are more people in the world now and therefore more people that unfortunately don’t understand good conservation practices. Time to bust out the Smokey the Bear PSAs again?"
,"Backburning is pretty common here and has been for years. The idea is to burn off areas in a controlled fashion so all the tinderbox material is gone and wildfires that break out are limited to smaller regions contained by areas that have been backburnt. 

Doesn't seem to be working so well. Fires are getting worse and more frequent. You'll need to wait for a greater expert than me on this for an evaluation."
,"We have this way of ending up with PMs that no one even remembers the names of - largely because they do f-all. It used to be a question to see whether a person/patient was oriented to time and place: ""who is the current prime minister?"" now, if they respond ""I don't know..."" we just nod and accept that, because no one bloody remembers. They're probably more oriented to time and place than if they'd given us a name. 

The young and the elderly are often most at risk. COPD in the elderly is exacerbated. Asthma in children more susceptible to respiratory distress is triggered.

 Schools have been having fire days (as opposed to snow days). It's a new kind of day off. 

And my cat always had asthma, but never this bad. This is the worst it's ever been. 

Thank you, though! I do hope!"

,"Respectfully, I am going to disagree with your post and the spirit of it in particular.  I really think you're looking at things completely wrong, or letting spooky news stories and Reddit echo chambers dictate your outlook.  Obviously AGW will be changing things and we need to stay diligent about its management. (Edit:  I won't be speaking on behalf of Australia, more the US).

Climate change mitigation isn't the tiger that we're waiting to ""just rip our throat out already and end it,"" in fact, it's a tiger that we shanked a good clean knife into, and it decided to run away, we're tracking its blood and is clearly now limping.  Why?

First of all, despite what the Orange Man [wants](https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/10/trump-steps-away-paris-climate-agreement-us-states-cities-and-businesses-step-up) there is actually a ton of work being done in the US.  The world's fifth largest economy has an unprecedented [commitment](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/11/17844896/california-jerry-brown-carbon-neutral-2045-climate-change) towards this.  In just a few short years, we've already gone from a ""very likely"" RCP8.5 scenario to an even [better](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario) outlook. Is 3-4c optimal?  Obviously not.  Are just sitting around with our thumbs up our asses?  You'd be a fool to think so.  I'm not even going to begin raking for news stories about sustainable energy costs vs coal, and even some turning tides on nuclear.

[Corals](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/great-barrier-reef-restoration-transplanting-corals/) are having more and more good news.  [Fires](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-49515462) are actually not markedly worse on a global scale.  There's [compelling](https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2019/01/Homewood-Hurricanes.pdf) research that would indicate storms are staying relatively in line with their historical trends.  Sea levels are rising at nearly the same [rate](https://climatechangedispatch.com/tidal-gauges-negligible-sea-level-rise/) they have for hundreds of years now.  And there's much more.

I would recommend heading to [happyeconews.com](https://happyeconews.com) or checking out r/climateactionplan \- I see on a daily basis far too many people here on Reddit getting duped into pretty disingenuous, unscientific and outright manipulative articles that are written to generate clicks and not actual scientific discourse of realistic policy interpretations.

Yes, we will warm, extreme events could have an uptick in activity and we'll pay for it - but to take every anomalous event as indicator of climate change is doing the same thing that a skeptic says when they ""record snowfall this last month, checkmate alarmists!""  Extreme events have and will always be an unfortunate but fundamental part of humans living on this wondrous planet.

,"I'm not an expert either but:

1. There's been a 3 year drought so far projected to last around another 4 years. As a result, everything (vegetation) is very much dead or dying and completely drying out, turning what little greenery we had into a country-sized box of matches.
2. The preventative measures - backburning - couldn't be carried out this year because the conditions need to be perfect. The backburning window we have always had is virtually non-existant now.

These conditions are completely unprecedented, there's no contingency plan for this."

,"I agree with the sentiment here a lot. 

The media lately seems to almost always be more extreme than the actual science on the issue. 

When I was younger I was really scared that climate change was going to cause all the ecosystems around me and around the world to basically die. 

This caused me to go school and study ecology. As I studied and began working in the field, meeting researchers, reading more, I found more and more that my perspective was becoming more moderated, and that most researchers I met had similar outlooks. 

It's a huge problem that we shouldn't understate. But the bold overstatements in the media don't help either, IMO. 

A few examples as of late. Koalas are functionally extinct due to the fires (they're not). The Amazon fires were far outside of the norm (they were about the same level as a decade ago before stronger protections were put in place. Still a problem but the media should report on it more objectively imo). There is an insect apocalypse (this has been disputed a number of times, and again, while its a problem, is nowhere near as immense and dire as the media reports make it seem). The permafrost is likely to all melt during our lifetimes (its not. The reality of the melt situation is much more long term, and likely won't all melt. Yet again its still a significant problem). 

In each case there are real, and serious issues. But they are reported on in such an extreme way that it drives people to become totally despondent, depressed, and to believe that the world is literally going to end. This to me is an opposite pole of unscientific thinking which also hampers our ability to act effectively on the issue. (Because if nobody can even imagine a likely future, and just think that we're all doomed anyway, then why even try?)."
,"I do not think that nothing is being done for climate. My state has vowed to uphold the paris agreement along with many other states in the US despite what the federal government thinks.

Flooding in other places I have lived in the US has also seen an uptick. it is hard to not be depressed and have a negative outlook on the future. 

So once again I appreciate the sentiment and understand it but I want to do more and see more done than what is being done. I am well aware of the science and data and for me. Not as bad as it could be is not good enough. I do a lot to support efforts to stop climate change through various ways but I want to do even more myself."

,"The narrative in my country, India, is all about how the west is committing a climate robbery in the name of climate justice. The west isn't interested in meeting it's low carbon reduction requirements, let alone the technology transfer and funding towards developing countries that's stuck in a quagmire due to domestic populism. A common narrative that's being pushed is that the great social security of the west is posited on exporting it's pollution to the developing world. Wealthy countries have reached a post industrial age where it's cheaper and easier for them to decarbonize, something there's no accountability for in any carbon reduction economics towards developing countries who have to balance emissions reductions with the shock on their economy. 

I am personally convinced by this argument, but I've often seen criticism in western papers of India as a bulwark against progress on climate change. A New York Times cartoon comes to mind which showed the Indian elephant blocking the climate change agreement train.

https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism

> Let’s begin with the concept of “primitive affluence”. It seems to be an article of faith among anarchoprimitivists that our hunting-and-gathering ancestors had to work an average of only two to three hours a day, or two to four hours a day ... the figures given vary, but the maximum stated never exceeds four hours a day, or 28 hours a week (average). [1] People who give these figures usually do not state precisely what they mean by “work”, but the reader is led to assume that it includes all of the activities necessary to meet the practical exigencies of the hunter-gatherers’ way of life.
>
> Characteristically, the anarchoprimitivists usually fail to cite their source for this supposed information, but it seems to be derived mainly from two essays, one by Marshall Sahlins (The Original Afluent Society [2]), and the other by Bob Black (Primitive Afluence [3]). Sahlins claimed that for the Bushmen of the Dobe region of Southern Africa, the “work week was approximately 15 hours.” [4] For this information he relied on the studies of Richard B. Lee. I do not have direct access to Lee’s works, but I do have a copy of an article by Elizabeth Cashdan in which she summarizes Lee’s results much more carefully and completely than Sahlins does. [5] **Cashdan flatly contradicts Sahlins: According to her, Lee found that the Bushmen he studied worked more than forty hours per week**. [6]
>
> **In a part of his essay that many anarchoprimitivists have found convenient to overlook, Bob Black acknowledges the forty-hour work-week and explains the foregoing contradiction: Sahlins followed early work of Lee that considered only time spent in hunting and foraging. When all necessary work was considered, the work-week was more than doubled**. [7] The work omitted from consideration by Sahlins and the anarchoprimitivists was probably the most disagreeable part of the Bushmen’s work-week, too, **since it consisted largely of food-preparation and firewood collection. [8] I speak from extensive personal experience with wild foods: Preparing such foods for use is very often a pain in the neck**. It is far more pleasant to gather nuts, dig roots, or hunt game than it is to crack nuts, clean roots, or skin and butcher game — or to collect firewood and cook over an open fire.
>
> The anarchoprimitivists also err in assuming that Lee’s findings can be applied to hunter-gatherers generally. It’s not even clear that those findings are applicable on a year-round basis to the Bushmen studied by Lee. **Cashdan cites evidence that Lee’s research may have been done at the time of year when his Bushmen worked least**. [9] She also mentions two other hunting-and-gathering peoples who have been shown quantitatively to spend far more time in hunting and foraging than Lee’s Bushmen did, [10] and she points out that Lee may have seriously underestimated women’s working time because he failed to include time spent on childcare.

> I’m not familiar with any other exact quantitative studies of hunter gatherers’ working time, **but it is certain that at least some additional hunter-gatherers worked a great deal more than the forty-hour week of Lee’s Bushmen**. Gontran de Poncins stated that **the Eskimos with whom he lived about 1939–1940 had “no significant degree of leisure”, and that they “toiled and moiled fifteen hours a day merely in order to get food and stay alive.”** [12] He probably did not mean that they worked fifteen hours every day; but it’s clear from his account that his Eskimos worked plenty hard.

> Among the Mbuti pygmies principally studied by Paul Schebesta, on days when the women did not fetch a supply of fruits and vegetables from the gardens of their village-dwelling neighbors, their gathering excursions in the forest lasted between five and six hours. Apart from their food-gathering, the women had considerable additional work to do. Each afternoon, for example, a woman had to go again into the forest and come back to camp panting and bowed under a huge load of firewood. The women worked far more than the men, but it seems clear from Schebesta’s account that the men nevertheless worked much more than the three or four hours a day claimed by the anarchoprimitivists. [13] Colin Turnbull studied Mbuti pygmies who hunted with nets. **Due to the advantage conferred by the nets, these Mbuti only needed to hunt about twenty hours per week. But for them: “Netmaking is virtually a full-time occupation... in which both men and women indulge whenever they have both the spare time and the inclination.”** [14] The Siriono, who lived in a tropical forest in Bolivia, were not pure hunter-gatherers, since they did plant crops to a limited extent at certain times of the year. But they lived mostly by hunting and gathering. [15] 
>
> **According to the anthropologist Holmberg, Siriono men hunted, on average, every other day. [16] They started at daybreak and returned to camp typically between four and six o’clock in the afternoon. [17] This makes on average at least eleven hours of hunting, and at three and a half days a week it comes to 38 hours of hunting per week, at the least**. Since the men also did a significant amount of work on days when they did not hunt, [18] their work-week, averaged over the year, had to be far more than 40 hours. And but little of this was agricultural work. [19] Actually, Holmberg estimated that the Siriono spent about half their waking time in hunting and foraging, [20] **which would mean roughly 56 hours a week in these activities alone. With other work included, the work-week would have had to be far more than 60 hours**. The Siriono woman “enjoys even less respite from labor than her husband”, and “the obligation of bringing her children to maturity leaves little time for rest.” [21] Holmberg’s book contains many other indications of how hard the Siriono had to work.

> In The Original Affluent Society, Sahlins gives, in addition to Lee’s Bushmen, other examples of hunting-and-gathering peoples who supposedly worked little, but in most of these cases he either offers no quantitative estimate of working time, or he offers an estimate only of time spent in hunting and gathering. If Lee’s Bushmen can be taken as a guide, this would be well under half the total working time. [23] However, for two groups of Australian Aborigines Sahlins does give quantitative estimates of time spent in “hunting, plant collecting, preparing foods and repairing weapons.” In the first group the average weekly time each worker spent in these activities was about 26 1/2 hours; in the second group about 36 hours. But this does not include all work; it says nothing, for example, about time spent on child care, in collecting firewood, in moving camp, or in making and repairing implements other than weapons. If all necessary work were counted, the work-week of the second group would surely be over 40 hours. The work-week of the first group did not represent that of a normal hunting-and-gathering band, since the first group had no children to feed. Sahlins himself, moreover, questions the validity of inferences drawn from these data. [24] Of course, even if occasional examples could be found of hunting-and-gathering peoples whose total working time was as little as three hours a day, that would matter little for present purposes, since we are concerned here not with exceptional cases but with the typical working time of hunter-gatherers. Whatever hunter-gatherers’ working hours may have been, much of their work was physically very strenuous. Siriono men typically covered about fifteen miles a day on their hunting excursions, and they sometimes covered as much as forty miles. [25] Covering such a distance in trackless wilderness [26] requires far more effort than covering the same distance over a road or a groomed trail.

> “In walking and running through swamp and jungle the naked hunter is exposed to thorns, to spines, and to insect pests... While the food quest is differentially rewarding because food for survival is always eventually obtained, it is also always punishing because of the fatigue and pain inevitably associated with hunting, fishing and collecting food.” [27] “Men often dissipate their anger toward other men by hunting. ... Even if they do not kill anything they return home too to be angry.” [28]
>
> Even picking wild fruit could be dangerous[29] and could take considerable work[30] for the Siriono. [31] The Siriono made little use of wild roots, [32] but it is well known that many hunter-gatherers relied heavily on roots for food. Usually, gathering edible roots in the wilderness is not like pulling carrots out of the soft, cultivated soil of a garden. More typically the ground is hard, or covered with tough sod that you have to hack through in order to get at the roots. I wish I could take certain anarchoprimitivists out in the mountains, show them where the edible roots grow, and invite them to get their dinner by digging for it. By the time they had enough yampa roots or camas bulbs for a halfway square meal, their blistered hands would disabuse them of any idea that primitives didn’t have to work for a living . Hunter gatherers’, work was often monotonous, too. This is true for example of root-digging when the roots are small, as is the case with many of the roots that were used by the Indians of western North America, such as bitterroot and the aforementioned yampa and camas. Picking berries is monotonous if you spend many hours at it.

> Or try tanning a deerskin. A raw, dry deerskin is stiff, like cardboard, and if you bend it, it will crack, just as cardboard will.
>
> In order to become usable as clothing or blankets, animal skins must be tanned. Assuming you want to leave the hair on the skin, as for winter clothing, there are only three indispensable steps to tanning a deerskin. First, you must carefully remove every bit of flesh from the skin. Fat in particular must be removed with scrupulous care, because any bit of fat left on the skin will rot it. Next, the skin must be softened. Finally, it must be smoked. If not smoked it will dry stiff and hard after a wetting and will have to be softened all over again. By far the most time-consuming step is the softening. It takes many hours of kneading the skin in your hands, or drawing it back and forth over the head of a spike driven into a block of wood, and the work is very monotonous indeed. I speak from personal experience. An argument sometimes offered is that hunter-gatherers who survived into recent times lived in tough environments, since all of the more hospitable lands had been taken over by agricultural peoples. Supposedly, prehistoric hunter-gatherers who occupied fertile country must have worked far less than recent hunter-gatherers living in deserts or other unproductive environments. [33] This may be true, but the argument is speculative, and I’m skeptical of it.

> I’m a bit rusty now, but I used to have considerable familiarity with the edible wild plants of the eastern United States, which is one of the most fertile regions in the world, and I would be surprised if one could live and raise a family there by hunting and gathering with less than a forty-hour work-week. The region contains a wide variety of edible plants, but living off them would not be as easy as you might think. Take nuts, for example. Black walnuts, white walnuts (butternuts), and hickory nuts are extremely nutritious and often abundant. The Indians used to collect huge piles of them. [34] If you found a few good trees in October, you could probably gather enough nuts in an hour or less to feed yourself for a whole day. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Yes, it does sound great — if you’ve never tried to crack a black walnut. Maybe Arnold Schwarzenegger could crack a black walnut with an ordinary nutcracker — if the nutcracker didn’t break first — but a person of average physique couldn’t do it. You have to whack the nut with a hammer; and the inside of the nut is divided up by partitions that are as thick and hard as the outer shell, so you have to break the nut into several fragments and then tediously pick out the bits of meat. The process is time-consuming. In order to get enough food for a day, you might have to spend most of the day just cracking nuts and picking out the bits of meat. Wild white walnuts (not to be confused with the domesticated English walnuts that you buy in the store) are much like black ones. Hickory nuts are not as difficult to cack, but they still have the hard internal partitions and they are usually much smaller than black walnuts. The Indians got around these problems by putting the nuts into a mortar and pounding them into tiny bits, shells, meats, and all. Then they would boil the mixture and put it aside to cool. The fragments of shell would settle to the bottom of the pot while the pulverized meats would settle in a layer above the shells; thus the meats could be separated from the shells. [35] This was certainly more efficient than cracking the nuts individually, but as you can see it still required considerable work. The Indians of the eastern U.S. utilized other wild foods that required more-or-less laborious preparation to make them edible. [36] It is hardly likely that they would have used such foods if foods that were more easily prepared had been readily available in sufficient quantity."

Scientists say net zero by 2050 is too late,
,"Looking for a discussion on this. David Spratt is known for multiple articles that tend towards climate alarmism. Many scientists seem to disagree with this, but if anybody has more info I'd love to hear from you!"
,"The WorldNews post of this article is basically an r/collapse post, yikes."
,"2030 is also too late, it needs to happen in the next 5 years simple as that, otherwise this has the ability to do more damage to the human race, than COVID19 has."
,"Not a scientist, just personal opinion, but it feels like the 2050 demarcation is a somewhat safe guide post for nations but that overall, they’re planning to beat that. I assume when they’re made they factor in current technologies plus projections of advancement, but time and time again we’ve seen price projections of new technologies be too conservative and them in reality being much cheaper (see: solar and in the middle of batteries). 

Also keep in mind that many govts have 2035 carbon free electricity goals, and upwards of 70-80% towards net zero by then.All of that seems super feasible (barring govt incentives and free market momentum, which all roads point go.) 

The only issue is the hard to decarbonize sectors (e.g. industry, planes, etc) and its hard to project with current technologies and new ones not yet out of prototype how quickly those can scale (or how much CDR technologies can ramp up to offset those) — but if both of those fall in line with other clean tech, those industries will develop and flourish quicker than expected and we’ll beat the 2050 targets for sure.

The only real thing that gets in the way is the ongoing degradation of the planet and in turn its affect on global gdp, climate migration, etc —— because depending how severe that all gets, if we know anything about humans, we’ll go into self-preservation- hoarding toilet paper -mode ... that’s my main fear, that we won’t ‘beat the clock’ with new systems and innovation in time for the inevitable climate breakdown that’s coming (and obviously aren’t sure how severe it will be by mid century)."

,"Net zero by 2050 total pie in the sky anyway. There is negligible chance of us achieving it. It’s less than 30 years away. We’ve been fretting over global warming over the past 30 years, and since then emissions have doubled, and yet somehow over the next 30 years they’ll be cut to zero? I mean, seriously? Do people honestly believe it? It’s utter delusion.

How on earth is it even vaguely possible when population is growing and half the planet is rapidly industrialising via fossil fuel usage?"
,"It's too late already. The second we started pulling ancient sunlight from the ground it was too late. The imbalance in the carbon cycle is much worse of a problem than the heating. Imagine shifting the concentration of oxygen by 70% either way? Dropping CO2 by 70%? All catastrophic. The only reason we're no acknowledging THIS as catastrophic is that we're in too deep to face it in its entirety. Can't add carbon to a carbon balanced system unless it's over an evolutionary timescale (1-2 ppm per decade)... yet here we are.   


We're going to keep being surprised by things getting worse, as we keep making them worse. Fossil carbon doesn't belong in our world. The more we add, the worse things get. It's that simple. Life only has capacity to stresses its been exposed to - it's how evolution works! There's no built-in capacity for one species to completely alter the chemistry of the atmosphere faster than that change can manifest in the system. And with COVID, we're burning more plastic than ever.   


Hope and optimism are earned through effort and change. As a default state they are purely destructive justifications to procrastinate. Currently, we have no hope. Now, look at your life like your future matters and make changes so we can hope again."
,"I didn't find this article alarmist at all.  Rather I agree with the general statement that ""net zero by 2050 is too late"".  The way the climate is changing, billions will be dead by 2050: storms, excessive heat, crop failures, ocean ecosystem failure, livestock losses, water shortages, sudden freezes, etc. 

I'd rather see something much more aggressive like ""net zero by 2030"" and some radical amount of carbon capture every decade to reduce CO2 to pre-industrial levels."
,I'll be surprised if there's a civilization left by 2050 haha.......I guess technically that would make us net zero after all.
,"The problem with these sort of articles is they are very alarmist. And also written in an extremely bleak and not productive way.

Let me be clear, climate change is a massive existential threat to us, we all know this. 

However, the problem with alarmist articles (apart from triggering all the doomists on Reddit shouting ‘we’re fucked!) is that they do very little to actually encourage action. There’s growing evidence that doomist reporting is being adopted by fossil fuel lobbyists as an argument to say ‘oh well, stopping isn’t going to help. We’re better off carrying on until science solves it for us’.

This article does seem to be targeted towards the Australian government. Which has required a bit of alarmism recently as their love for coal shows no sign of abating and Aus is likely to suffer much more than a lot of western nations.

One thing that needs to be pointed out, consistently. Is actually the positives of the current changing perception of climate change and the investment in renewables and carbon capture.

Yes, the numbers are painfully low still (+1-2% increases). However what the IPCC and a lot of climatologists agree is that at this stage is that change is going to be fairly small for a while. There’s massive cultural, technological and infrastructural hurdles that need to be crossed before mass adoption can take place. These changes are happening now in many places and are setting up for more widespread adoption 2025+. We can’t just stop coal plants etc, it’s a gradual change.

Another key point is cultural and technological adoption is generally led by the west and China. Hopefully with Biden the US will pick up pace. The key to this is not only that the largest contributors reduce their CO2, but that they provide proof of concept and ease of access for the LEDC’s to adopt them cheaply and en-mass. This is important for nations in Africa especially as they can build mass solar farms that allow them to trade energy with other countries. Helping them economically and reducing CO2 potential in the developing world. 

So TL:DR: this article is alarmist. While the data may turn out to be ok, the tone is unhelpful. When actually doomism is helping the carbon industry. Also there’s a lot of good stuff going on now and experts should work on selling the economic benefits of green energy rather than trying to scare/guilt nations."
,"Its interesting but Spratt isn't a climate scientist. He's also alarmist and has some pretty racist views on migration. 

I'll keep listening to scientists on this one."
,You said it your self.. Spratt is an alarmist.. Not much more to it
,too late for what is the obvious question ?
,"It really depends on what you mean by catastrophic. I highly doubt 4 degrees of warming will make advanced civilization impossible because global warming isn't an amorphous blob like journalists think. The human effects are *highly* unequally distributed. Poor people on low-lying land in hot climates with fickle rainfall could lose everything, but middle-class people in temperate climates away from the coast will be able to adjust.

Plus, civilization is highly adaptable and resillient. We already live in an extremely wide range of climate conditions, resource availability, and cultural practices. We've survived smaller degrees of natural climate change, migration to drastically different climates, Ghengis Khan, the Black Death, and atomic bombs."

,"Climate change is already doing far more damage than Covid. CO2 accounts for over 5 million deaths annually. 

While it’s agreed that zero emissions needs to happen ASAP. The next 5 years is not going to happen. It’s going to take 5 years for engaged countries to sort out infrastructure and tooling to be able to mass produce the stuff needed. 

The key is being able to scale up to zero emissions in a reasonable timeframe. If we say 10 years. It’s not going to be a linear progression of 10% reduction each year. The greatest change will happen towards the end."

,"The problem with dooming (as both the article and your post do) is that it actually encourages inaction through hopelessness.

Right now, the scientific community are much better suited for massively promoting the multiple benefits of renewables and nuclear. Reduced overheads, reduced costs to governments and medical industries etc). 

The thing is, things are actually changing quickly and the trend is good. Is it quick enough? Not yet no. But it’s getting there."
,Ancient... sunlight???
,"Good comment that succinctly encapsulates what many climate scientists I've been following have been saying for a while.

Reject both denial and doom and instead work on solutions, raising awareness and encouraging those around you to do the same. We've got a hell of a lot more to lose if we choose inaction.

>While the data may turn out to be ok

Funnily enough, I didn't find any citations for their claims in the article."
,"“(Problem with alarmism) is that they do very little to actually encourage action.” 

I see this claim posted a lot and it feels intuitively right to me. However, I am wondering if there is actual scientific evidence that says that people who read alarming reports tend to act less. Is is a folk Psychology assumption that we all have or is there actually something behind this claim?

I guess the other side of me thinks that perhaps enough alarmism can also cause people to change their behavior. Like people who get lung cancer and finally stop smoking cigarettes. By your logic, people who get lung cancer from smoking should just keep smoking once the doctor gives them the alarming news, but I know a lot of people have been completely woken up by lung cancer and stoped smoking (of course my sample size is very small)."
,"I know this is five days after the fact but this comment fucking opened my eyes. I’m not a denier, far from it, but I’ve rarely if ever seen on Reddit this take- most comments on Reddit when it comes to climate change are ‘we’re fucked’ and naturally that sends me into a tailspin. Idk who you are stranger but you’ve boosted my mood a TON."
,">There’s growing evidence that doomist reporting is being adopted by fossil fuel lobbyists as an argument to say ‘oh well, stopping isn’t going to help. We’re better off carrying on until science solves it for us’.

Where is this evidence and are more and more people starting to believe what fossil fuel lobbyists say?

Is there a point at which scientists should start telling the public it should be alarmed?"

,"I wish memory could be shared. If you saw what this looks like under water and how far advanced it is, you'd be running around like I am. Humanity doesn't help. We burn resources for ourselves, and unless you guys stop deciding anything with a group focus is evil and communist, it's going to stay that way. 

Doing nothing, at this point, is better than contributing to the problem. Until we have a meaningful direction, whether we're burning green resources or black ones, we're still burning things to stop the fire from getting worse. We do see the absurdity in the race to find a technological fix to the problem created by our fixation with technology, yes?

The ""rush"" we're putting on all this doesn't help because that translates into resource usage. To get resource usage down, we need to take only what we need. But we're not going to because people like yourself insist on perpetuating this idea that we're going to get our shit together at some point and unsink the ship. It's not helping and hasn't helped over the last 20 years that we've wasted. 

How much harder is it to come up with climate fixes with COVID happening? How much easier do you think it's going to get, where we can resume some sort of focus on edging in a green direction? This war requires the willingness to stop taking, and to find value in existence outside the material. 

Or we keep pretending we're on our way to fixing this and make it worse faster. 

What technology are you so optimistic about that it's going to allow for us to continue living like this in perpetuity? Is it doomerism or have we created a doomsday machine that we need to walk away from? How does this paradigm not end in the extinction of all life? And if you're going to say ""technology"" can you share exactly which technology is so promising, how we're going to power it, and how we're going to build it while up to our tits in virus, parasites, water, and god knows what? 

I'm not saying we give up on life, I'm saying we face the reality of the world we've created and work from there. What we're doing now is focusing on the tech and money and projecting that onto the world; we're trying to solve a problem we have right now with imaginary tools that don't exist. It's time to be real about this and what to expect or we're all just lying to ourselves and might as well keep burning oil. Whether you burn the oil to heat your home or burn it to make a solar panel really doesn't matter."
,"It's a very sloppy way of saying that locked-up energy, in the form of coal and oil, was created by plants which fell into bogs, compressed, and eventually turned into coal and oil.  The plants *used* the sunlight, which eventually became coal, and hence in a roundabout if inaccurate way it's ""ancient sunlight""."
,"would you agree that wood is the work done by a plant using the sun, but really it's just the sun's energy converted into chemical work. That chemical work accumulates in the form of cellulose etc. When you burn through a log of wood, you're literally burning through the time that tree was alive for, and the sunlight that landed on that tree drove that accumulation at a relatively constant rate. The energy stored in plants is the energy of the sun. Oil is the product of 100M years of compression on various stages of ~peat decomposition, which is also energy of the sun. I think it's something like 70 acres of pasture worth of accumulation in one barrel of oil, so 70/acre years of sunlight are in one barrel of oil... something like that. But it's truly the product of 100's of thousands of years of ideal growing conditions more than 100M years ago, all being released into our air. It's a solar debt that we've created and reinforce every year so every year the concentration goes up rather than stabilizing.

All major forms of energy are driven by the sun... or a sun, in the case of nuclear

My point is, the CO2 and what it represents is more than just a gas, it's a gassified ecosystem that we're breathing into ours. It couldn't NOT be destabilizing by the nature of biochemistry and how everything is dependent on partial pressures. A 70% increase is an insane amount of life-gas/time/sunlight to dump into a system before the system can even fix half of it."
,"Me neither. And I agree, I’ve been feeling quite anxious about climate change for a while, but staying away from media articles and sticking to expert reports and academic stuff actually left me feeling more positive and engaged. 

For example. When you look at renewables share of total energy production, it hasn’t dented fossil fuels very much. But this is because it has been offset by the reduction in Nuclear. So going forward with both nuclear and renewables being adopted it should start to be noticeably growing very soon."

Made me very distrusting"
,"No problem friend. I also go into anxiety spirals over this even now. But I have to tell myself this, and also another key point that is overlooked.

Almost all of these predictions are based on A) we do nothing. Or B) we stay with the targets we set now.

Both of these are very negative scenarios. We definitely aren’t doing nothing, and all signees of the Paris Agreement know that the initial targets are whack. But that’s why they are initial targets. Each nation will use 2050 as a baseline and work out how easy/hard it will be to hit or beat that. 2023 was set as the ‘stocktake year’ where nations will use these projections and see where aid, stronger targets, CO2 exchanges (i.e. if Japan can’t hit because there’s no space-they provide funding to Canada who can hit theirs AND overshoot by planting etc) etc.

The Paris Agreement has been shit on a lot here because there’s no legal repercussions for not hitting targets. But the agreement has some really strong partnership working stuff in it that IS working. 

It’s a long way to go, and it’s going to be hard (especially the 1.5-<2C). But there’s a lot to be hopeful for right now."
,"The public don’t believe the lobbyists. However governments do (and right wing public like the vast majority of Republicans on r/conservative etc). 

Or actually, they understand they are being lied to, but the lie gets easier for them to bear for the 4-5 years that they are in power and earn their money. 

Scientists have been raising the alarm for decades. But defeatism and emotional panic won’t convince those in power that are shit scared of dipping the economy. Short term thinking of course and thank god it’s changing. But now that low/zero emission tech is not only affordable, but profitable there’s no reason why big money won’t invest in it. Just like Shell, BP and now Exxon Mobil are starting to.

It’s a slow burn. But screaming at these people isn’t going to get them on side in the same way as screaming at the public to ‘do better!’ It makes people despondent. 

Human nature is crazy like that. I work in Flood management and you can tell people all day long if they don’t prepare they will flood. They won’t do it. Engagement is key. And the scientific community at large has figured that out and are turning the cogs. 

Instead of “do this now or doom!” It’s “do this now and we can be safer AND richer ;)”"

,"The article talked about the next 25 years of warming looks like 0.25-0.35C/decade. If you check NASA temperature data you will see that a best fit linear graph is 2.07C/decade over the last 30 years, 2.29C/decade over the last 20 years and 4.18C/decade over the last 10 years.

I’ve not been in the industry a huge amount of time.

But my big push at the minute is more joined up thinking. So if we want to manage flood risk in village x, we work with other organisations to include biodiversity net gain, large scale tree planting etc. Sounds really obvious but it’s surprising how little joined up thinking there’s been previously. 

Early days atm, but there’s a real growing enthusiasm for it here. Hopefully I’ll be able to make a tiny difference in the long run.

This discussion was more the method of delivering that message, and that overly aggressive, preachy messaging doesn’t engage and leads to further inaction. 

I think my argument is it’s a really fine line between engaging and promoting action, and accidentally giving the impression everything’s going swimmingly and there’s no urgency. 

Hopelessness/doomism doesn’t work, but too much hope leads to complacency. It’s a tough act to get right, but the positive is that the community as a whole is hitting the right cord and it’s starting to get wings.

If it gets as bad as these scientists are saying if not enough gets done the public will justly ask why didn't someone say that was going to happen.

,"**[Climate change feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate change feedback)**

Climate change feedback is important in the understanding of global warming because feedback processes may amplify or diminish the effect of each climate forcing, and so play an important part in determining the climate sensitivity and future climate state. Feedback in general is the process in which changing one quantity changes a second quantity, and the change in the second quantity in turn changes the first. Positive (or reinforcing) feedback amplifies the change in the first quantity while negative (or balancing) feedback reduces it.The term ""forcing"" means a change which may ""push"" the climate system in the direction of warming or cooling. An example of a climate forcing is increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

There are several tipping points that drive the climate that we don't know if they have already happened or when/if they will happen in the near future. Right now the rate of temperature increase is increasing. Are you saying it is impossible the earth warms by 5 degrees by 2100?"
,"Yeah, I have two young children and I am desperate to try and ensure they have a better future than we had. Although that’s not looking great right now I’m optimistic it will be. I’m 34 so a lot of it won’t get me either. But I want to be able to turn around and say ‘I did my bit’. 

I guess alarmist can also be a positive as well if it drives you and others to action. I just see a lot of alarmist stuff on here and hordes of ‘we’re fucked!’ ‘What’s the point?’ Posts. Defeatism frustrates me so I try and show the good things that are happening as well. Because encouragement is essential to drive political change."
,I see your point and I absolutely agree. Maybe a combination of all approaches is the best to hit a cord with the widest audience.
,"It;s about two things - 1. the extent of warming and 2. whether we can control that kind of outcome. If warming reaches a critical level - say 6 degrees or more (which is not at all impossible) - and nothing we can do stops it, the knock on effects of anoxic oceans and collapsing ecosystems can lead to global mass extinctions, threatening human civilization and ultimately life on Earth as we know it. A planet with runaway warming is not bound by human scales of disaster. It will hardly even notice one more extinction event in geological terms."

Not everyone agrees with your tipping point opinion. [Here](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/33/19656) is a report that discusses that issue. The part that worries me the most is:

“—recall that RCP8.5 2005 to 2020 total cumulative CO2 emissions are within 1% of historical emissions—the issue of missing carbon cycle climate feedbacks is critical. In effect, these will act to raise both IEA scenarios toward the cumulative emissions represented by RCP8.5 and away from RCP4.5. These missing biotic feedbacks include permafrost thaw, changes in soil carbon dynamics, changes to forest fire frequency and severity, and spread of pests ([**10**](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/33/19656#ref-10)). While it is unclear the extent to which these missing pathways would close the emissions gap—our level of understanding here is low”

Well I'm sure you could not possibly be wrong. However it reminds me of a conversation I had with a conservative friend of mine several months ago when COVID first started in the US. He projected 10,000 people would die from the pandemic and wanted to bet on how many I thought would die. I told him that it was too morbid to bet on but it would be over 100,000. He laughed and said that was impossible."

Then, suddenly, 200 years ago, this all changed with the invention of electricity & machines. Now we've made the climate safe - the safest climate for humans in the history of planet earth.

Sometimes they can miss out on key things.

Taking a look at some of the predictions from the past it seems to be exactly as I've described. Some being overzealous, and some too conservative. There is also some bang on. However, the general consensus has shown to be a steady rise in global emissions and global temperatures. This is exactly what happened. 

[This analysis](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming) shows predictions made in the past about the global rise in temperature. What it largely shows is that the majority of predictions were very accurate give or take for some studies that varied from too much to too little to what has actually been observed.

,"The scientific consensus was that the earth is at risk of going to an ice age. The second scientific consensus was that the planet is going to overpopulated and can't feed itself. That's what I learned growing up in school in the early 90s. Pretending it's just a single newspaper making up something every 10 years is rewriting history. Nobody talked about global warming in the 90s until Al Gore came along with his movie.

If only the his was what was reported rather than the hype from the likes of Al Gore. Who wasn't considered to be a non scientist but in fact given the Nobel prize for his alarmism. 

Over the last 6,000 years the temperature varied naturally until the industrial revolution when fossil fuels began emitting CO2. The temperature has continued to vary within the same range. 

The initial IPCC predictions of global temperature were far higher than they currently are. Hopefully the level of alarmism will abate as well."

you dont know what you are talking about yet you keep pretending you do.

,"the paper you posted doesn't discuss temperatures. it says right there in the title. it doesn't even include the graph you mentioned. (you only copied the link from the wikipedia). you dont know whats the origin of such data or how reliable it is, nor did you even read or understood such paper. **but even if the graph is correct and reliable (and not a temptative stimation for example) it doesn't disprove anthropogenic global warming AT ALL** then of course such data doesnt exist. theres no 12000 year cycle that explains this. there has never been such data.

1.  because the rate of warming is a fuckthousand faster than the one related to milankovich cycles which you can see in that graph take hundreds of thousands of years. you have seen geological changes that should take more than a thousand years happen in your lifetime. you are feeling it. yet you believe propaganda instead that this is a tens of thousands years cycle. in less than 100 years temps have gone up 1.5 degrees. that takes more than a thousand years in times of planetary crisis!!! let alone normally!!. and they are going to climb to + 10. thats uninhabitable for us (+3 degrees already is) and should take waaaaaaaay more than ten thousand years. you would live to see it but youll die before.

2. you saw how i posted how well models predict warming comparing them to all data sources? you know why they work so well? because they rely on the warming caused by co2 to explain the warming. all other factors cant explain it. suggesting its something else its like having a teapot boiling on the outside on a stove but suggesting it might be the sun or the warm air and not the fire the main cause of the water boiling when you know very well how much heat each factor causes.


3. many factors infuence the climate and while the effect of the melankovich cycles would be greatly influential. they are i flu3nced by other stuff... like obviously co2. which is much more important evidently to decide their result.


co2 (obviously) is the main controller of the planets temperature. its high school physics man. you can test in your kitchen how co2 traps heat, calculate how much and then use that data to calculate the planets temps.

Really?  Couldn't you find it in the title. 

>theres no 12000 year cycle that explains this

Cycles are cumulative. The motion of the sun and solar systems are all cyclical. At times the amplitudes of cycles are additive when they are in phase and cancel when out of phase. Different amplitudes, different phases, all natural influencing each other to varying degrees.  Some daily, some over many millennia, and some over greater periods like the 250 million year cycle of the solar system around the centre of the galaxy. In lingo you may understand there is  fuckthounds of cycles."
,">you know why they work so well? because they rely on the warming caused by co2 to explain the warming

I am skeptical of claims from people that say they know how a complex system works and it is only one influence that controls any change

I have no problem with you accepting this but l don't.

We should abolish lawns,"The fact that we still have lawns full of short grass that we methodically mow once a week is a significant contributor to climate change. 

Firstly, by replacing whatever natural vegetation would grow in the area with short grass, we reduce the land's ability to take in CO2. By preventing the grass from growing tall, we significantly reduce the amount of CO2 we keep out of the atmosphere, and prevent native ecosystems from developing. Even if grass grows at the same rate whether it's constantly mowed or not, we could replace lawns with forests to fight climate change.

But secondly, and more importantly, lawn mowing consumes a huge amount of resources. In addition to the CO2 produced by the fossil fuels in lawn mowers (or the equivalent energy cost of electric lawnmowers), fertilizers produce nitrous oxide, a very powerful greenhouse gas.

According to https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa8nan/your-well-manicured-lawn-is-contributing-to-climate-change, a maintained lawn contributes about as much to climate change as a transatlantic flight. If 100 million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns, that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions, and that's not counting planting trees to replace the lawns with forests. It's an area no one seems to be talking about, but it seems like we could get a decent impact just by telling people to stop doing something."
,"How big are your lawns that you could replace them with forests? I take your point, it's an interesting use of resources that I'd not considered!"
,"Like the post, glad that when I first read the title ""we should abolish laws"" turned out to be me reading it wrong"
,"Trees are so much nicer too!

Good post."
,"Home owners associations are the real problem. 8 out of 10 people don't want to mow a lawn weekly. 9/10 people still want to look at their homes from the outside and be like ""Yeah... I want to go to there.""

Home Owners Associations are the ones who say shit like: YOU MUST HAVE GRASS, and SAID GRASS MUST ALWAYS BE BETWEEN 2.1 - 2.7 inches tall. If you fail to conform.... well... YOU DON'T BELONG HERE - WE WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE HORRIBLE BECAUSE GRASS m'kay?  ""Thanks neighbor.""

I honestly think more people would welcome natural plants instead of the Sisyphean task that is grass, any day."
,"Done this, can recommend. Although the forest part is difficult, trees are slow-growers. It attracts many birds, bees, butterflies and other insects (spiders, worms, slugs, moths), plus their predators (cats, foxes). It smells divine and I sometimes eat some of the berries. It's an oasis for the animals in an urban desert. I think it looks amazing but I know some people think it's ""untidy"". I am like yes and that's the way it's meant to be. My neighbors have complained once about a ""large amount of vegetation"". It was trimmed. It takes up a large amount of water, stores a large amount of carbon, nourishes the soil, prevents erosion and hosts a compost heap. The compost heap recycles all the green waste, onsite with no transport or disposal costs. The recycled nutrients never leave the property and instead make the garden even bigger. Dry woody waste, which can be up to 50% pure carbon, is stored in a flat pile which I occasionally walk/jump on and rake out the smashed pieces over the ground, where I leave them to rot amongst leaf litter. It makes the ground a bit higher, I'm considering making some terracing. I'm a bit worried about a fire. As a fire-break I do keep a clear perimeter - with lawn on it - near the house.

See also: rewilding, urban meadows movement, permaculture (slightly guessing these, still researching)

Edit: more (I love this topic) - it creates ecosystems, of many kinds. It breeds all kinds of animals and they go and make healthier ecosystems on the surrounding properties. I am worried it might be a home for rats, but I'm hoping the cats will fix that. It's a fabulous opportunity to get hands-on with the workings of ecosystems, evolution and nature. The metaphors and lessons that are contained within are broadly applicable to all ecosystems, all life. All I do is remove the stuff I don't want. I occasionally dump collected rainwater on the compost heap. That's an ecosystem all to itself. One of the birds has figured out that when I rearrange the compost heap, it's feeding time. He loves the spiders and also small bugs. He will hover for spiders. He's got so bold he will get in the way of me watering it. He sings quietly to himself as he patiently awaits the next insect to break cover.

Edit: more 2 (...) - it also keeps me fit, gives me some sun, purifies my air, and gives me time away from work, my screens, and indoors in general. The peace and quiet is a very pleasant way to unwind. So personal health benefits as well as the rest."
,My aunt lives in California and they turned their lawn into a rock garden because of the droughts they didn't want to water their lawn. It looks amazing and obviously has 0 upkeep required.
,"There are a lot of things that people \*should\* do. But they don't and it is not very practical to force them to. We really need a better solution of how to push people to change.

Case in point, the impossible burger is the perfect example. The basic tenet is that people are just not going to give up beef, and we have to trick them to do so.

In this case, i believe it is a great idea but i highly doubt you can move even a fraction of the household to do so. Social inertia is difficult to overcome. The question is that, given limited resources, what should we push people to do. I believe turning to green energy may be the easiest, than say ask them to drastically change how they manage their lawn. At where i live, we have the choice of which company we buy power from, so we choose one that deliver renewables ... even if it is a bit more expensive (which i do not really know) .. it is a lot easier for people to switch to, then more drastic changes."
,">The fact that we still have lawns full of short grass that we methodically mow once a week is a significant contributor to climate change.

>If 100 million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns, that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions,

From the article:

>So in the end, a neatly manicured swatch of green could end up producing the equivalent amount of greenhouse gas emissions as one transcontinental flight every year. That adds up to an estimated US total equivalent of about 25 million tons of carbon dioxide, [Appalachian State University geochemist Chuanhui Gu] said.

>That's a tiny piece of the total US carbon emissions of 6 billion-plus tons in 2012

25m / 6b = 0.42%

,"If we do this, we will need to bolster our park support in suburban areas.  Kids, dogs, frisbee people etc need open space to run around, which imo is the ONLY rationale for lawns.

,I agree with this. This isn’t growing trees but many houses at the New Jersey shore have small pebbles instead of grass. Many people rent out their beach houses and won’t be there to mow the lawns anyway. And they aren’t wasting money and gas for the upkeep. We pay someone to mow ours. It’s just one more thing no one wants to do.
,I've been struggling with this. How do we keep down dangerous pests like ticks that carry Lyme disease or mosquitoes? That's a big challenge for me. I have a newborn son coming into the world and it scares me.
,"If I don’t mow my lawn I get shamed by the neighbors and a hefty fine from the city. I planted shrubs and gardens to shrink my lawn size. The problem with trees in a smaller yard is that they interfere with power lines, clog sewer lines, and can be a hazard.  The money you would spend on tree maintenance could better be used for solar panels or something.  
   I do see homeowners with vast acreage in the suburbs mowing, watering, and fertilizing their entire property for some reason. Also some folks way too worried about dandelions or other such weeds are constantly dumping chemicals in their yards to control them. It usually tends to be retired individuals that are overly concerned about their lawns."
,The much worse thing is when people pave over/replace their small area of grass with gravel
,"On a lighter note, you can keep rabbits in movable cages and let them eat the grass.  Rabbit meat is good.  If the neighbors complain you can say they are your service rabbits.  I live rurally so I just let my grass grow till it falls over.  It also has clover (red, yellow & white), yarrow, dogbane, St.Johnswort, wild asters, ferns, some other stuff as well as some noxious weeds I have to fight by hand to keep it all organic for the garter snakes and other wildlife."
,"Maybe turn it into plantations. Some lawns are located in  much better locations than the locations farmers use to plant their crops. Almond trees in the middle of the desert taking up underground water reservois, for example, makes no sense at all... All the while, places with more rain like Maryland or Pennsylvania are filled with these lawns which are a waste of land resources..."

,"I have a very hard time believing that my lawn contributed the same amount of CO2 as a transatlantic flight.  I don't see how it can be remotely possible.

But I agree with your overall point.  We should fully fence off our properties and do whatever we want with all land on it - plant trees, flowers, vegetable gardens, let it do its own thing.  It's stupid to have so much space wasted.  It does look nice but it's not worth the cost and the effort to maintain it."
,"I read something before about the impact of replacing the grass lawn format with moss lawns instead. Moss eats more CO2 than grass, and it doesn’t grow vertically, but horizontally, negating the need to mow it. Probably just need to edge it or something along the house and street. Anybody else know the research article I’m talking about and could link it possibly? It’d be much appreciated."
,CO2 conversion could best be resolved by planting more trees instead of abolishing lawns.
,"We need real solutions. Until we eliminate fossil fuels from our energy consumption, anything else is just beating around the bush. For that reason I really hope fusion comes around."
,"Valid reasoning. Doesn't make sense whatsoever in maintaining a lawn for the sake of visual aesthetics. Instead we could be using the same patch of land to grow trees or may be a mix of both, but more Trees will help in carbon sequestration."
,"I'm not a US resident, so I'm not sure how things work there (with the HOA posts and whatever) but a bigger concern for me is the absolute lack of biodiversity in such gardens and the water (which also gets poluted by all those fertilizers and pesticides) needed to keep those pristine, greener-than-green lawns.

Here in Switzerland is common to see public green spaces with tall grass until June or so. This allows insects to populate those places and when cut down, some patches are left untouched so they can still migrate somewhere near and safe. I gotta say, seeing all the flowers and sometimes kids or dogs play in there is nice :-) In suburban areas with a lot of one-family homes, short grass is the norm though...

Also, since this country is so very densely populated, there's a lack of natural environments where biodiversity can be left to it's own devices, so this kind of things are really needed. In the Americas there's still tons of more or less untouched landscapes, something with lack in Europe."
,"we should abolish restrictive zoning and land use codes that force everyone to have lawns. Denser living would mean shorter (and sometimes walkable) commutes, more efficient transit, and more room for actual forest instead of suburban hellscapes."
,I've always been against lawns. They have their places. I suppose you could call them a cheap way of making a playground for kids. Cover a lot with grass and call it a park and encourage kids to play. Good use and cheap. But not the right thing for every damn house. I blame it on American women. And the men that just let them do whatever they like.
,"there was a ted talk from a guy who made little micro forests, they were some very small space like 5x5 feet or something. definitely something many families could accomplish"

People have a variety of desires when it comes to what type of neighborhood they want to live in. There isn't any good reason not to let them be the primary authority on that issue. Although sometimes the interests of larger groups will contend with local interests via regulation — most fruitfully in areas of redevelopment or new development.

But many regions have that system right now — doesn't yours? If a municipality in your region wants to get rid of single-family zoning in favor of multiple-unit, mixed-use, or commercial...what obstacles do they face? 

In my region, municipalities generally do have this power. So where I live, we already have a system which allows the elimination of single-family zoning in favor of other types.

(Although there are strict limits on where industrial zones can be sited. Environmental and land-use regulations would need to be consulted first.)"

I'll just ignore your condescension. I don't know why you are so confused. I'm not proposing radically changing how zoning is established. I'm saying Single Family Zoning (R1) is just not one that should be used, whether at the city level or banning it from the state level.

> Who has authority to determine zoning rules for a municipality? 

I'm talking about what zoning policy areas \*should\* enact, it is not complicated."
,"> I'm saying Single Family Zoning (R1) is just not one that should be used, whether at the city level or banning it from the state level.

But obviously it *should* be used, if the relevant set of voters (usually in the municipality) opt for it. I don't see how another system can properly accommodate the wishes of locals who actually live in the district. 

You've consistently ignored that consideration, which is pretty fundamental to the political process in a democracy. If you've somehow taken this into consideration and I've missed it, now would be a good time to restate your views on this. 

Until then, you're talking like someone who's pretty uninformed about how the political process works on local matters like zoning. And being uninformed often leads to holding opinions that are impractical or indefensible, which seems to be where you're at on this issue."

,"> The number of people who could live there, the people suffering over the negative consequences of R1 zoning are just as relevant people.

In their own zoning district, yes. That's where the political system gives them an express opportunity to have their voice heard. But the authority of people in one zoning district doesn't typically extend to legal matters in another zoning district, for good reasons. 

>And in a democracy, state and federal law can override local laws.

They can — but in the US, most states have expressly delegated zoning power to local authorities. Specifically because local authorities are in the best position to make zoning decisions. Because of this principle that it's the locals who live in a district whose authority should be primary for neighborhood-character issues like zoning. 

You're just trying to find different ways to evade this obvious principle of local governance. Which makes you seem very uninformed on the topic. 

Possibly someday states will take greater control of local zoning matters. Oregon has just done so. But they've done so via the political process, where the decision has been made by Oregon voters, and thus every eligible voter has had a chance to participate on this issue and make their voices heard."
,"> for good reasons

People rent-seeking isn't a good reason.

Anyways, the conversation has gone off rails a bit; saying R1 zoning shouldn't be used doesn't require saying what mechanism should be used to abolish it. That's a completely different issue than whether if it should be abolished."
,"Zoning is expressly a political issue — a *local* political issue, in the great majority of jurisdictions. You can't meaningfully discuss zoning *in the real world* without addressing the mechanism of local politics, and sometimes its interaction with the politics of larger districts.

It looks exactly like internal variability in the climate system should look--long periods (low frequency variability) that mute a signal.

Because it's all we have local records for, basically.  They're the only ones that we can use for local temperatures.

It's like when financial advisors try to get you to invest by showing you a market average chart starting in 2009- the return to normal looks like a huge gain. In addition, if some temperatures are above normalized levels there will appear to be an even more dramatic swing. Temperatures are certainly above normalized levels now but they are not above normalized levels to the extreme that this image would suggest."

>Temperatures are certainly above normalized levels now but they are not above normalized levels to the extreme that this image would suggest.

This is self-contradictory. They are, but they aren't? Is your problem with the choice of baseline or is your problem that the data shown is wrong? Temperatures have risen compared to the 1850-1900 baseline and they have risen by the amount shown. The baseline could be chosen whenever, **but it would not be instructive to do so.**

Your appeal to the Little Ice Age doesn't make any sense. Your argument seems to be that the climate is just returning to pre-Little Ice Age ""normal,"" (by what physical mechanism, and why does the climate have a preferred normal?). But global temperatures have surpassed the temperatures before the Little Ice Age. In fact, global temperatures are the hottest they have been over the Common Era. Moreover, that entire reversal of the 1000 year trend occurred in \~75 years. As such, your appeal to a ""return to normal"" is not only entirely irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic climate change, but also flat out wrong.

,"What l think he was saying was, in other words, that had there not been a increase in CO2 levels, the temp would still have risen from the relative low temperatures of the little ice age. 

It is hard to imagine that the temperature would have remained cold, and not followed the cyclic trends of the past, had it not been for the increase in CO2

Some people believe that CO2 is totally responsible for increased temps, others that natural cause have an influence of various degrees."
,"> Is your problem with the choice of baseline or is your problem that the data shown is wrong? 

Both could be a problem. A global mean back to 1850 is only as reliable as the model used to create it. 

> As such, your appeal to a ""return to normal"" is not only entirely irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic climate change, but also flat out wrong.

Sorting out how much is human caused and how much is natural seems pretty relevant."
,Is the visualisation “better” than a simple time series or even the climate stripes. It’s come from dataisbeautiful so is meant to be a good example of visualising climate data. I’m not convinced that it is.

,"He's claiming that the observed rise in global temperature over the 20th century is the result of the climate ""normalizing"" because the graphic chose a baseline that follows the Little Ice Age.

It's not clear if he denies anthropogenic warming, but he certainly ignores it by appealing to some misguided ""normalization"" principle."
,">Sorting out how much is human caused and how much is natural seems pretty relevant.

Except nothing u/serial-lab has said sheds light on that question at all. The choice of baseline is completely arbitrary. It was chosen in this case because it's the relevant period of anthropogenic forcing.

I don't think you understand what I meant. The claim that we are ""returning to normal"" is not only ill-defined, and useless for attributing climate change, it's also simply wrong if he means in comparison to the Common Era average temperatures before the Little Ice Age. You cannot attribute climate change simply by appealing to some vague financial principle of regression to a mean."
,"Personally I *like* that you can separate our what month you want to look at for each year. That's actually a huge improvement in my mind, because before (despite already being convinced that global warming is real) it kinda irked me that someone could say, well that's just the average (possibly thinking an average just once a year or something if they don't understand or trust scientists), ""what about the specific months!"" Maybe thinking scientists could be hiding some valuable details there. This nicely alleviates that mystery about how the months themselves played out during all that time.

Edit: realized my other info wasn't needed."
,"fair enough, good point"
,"An ice age implies below-average temperatures.  So, if that's the definition of an ice age, then starting an analysis of long term temperatures based on the starting point being at a below-average level then naturally the results will seem exaggerated.  It's not misguided.   I'm just being logical."
,"It likely also has to do with the fact that there weren't too many people keeping detailed temperature logs back then and that was the date they decided the temperature data was complete enough to make some of a guess of the global mean temperature.

Whether or not the baseline is arbitrary doesn't change the person's point. If that time happened to be cool, we might expect this trend regardless of human influence. I don't believe that is the case but it shows the limitations of drawing too strong of conclusions from data/charts like this."
,"You haven't listened to anything I have said. This graphic is not ""an analysis"" it's an accurate representation of instrumental data.

The warming experienced since the beginning of the instrumental record actually completely surpasses the cooling caused by the Little Ice Age. In \~75 years we have experienced a warming which actually surpasses any temperature experienced in the Common Era.

>An ice age implies below-average temperatures.

In order to take an average a time-span must be specified over which the average was taken. Little Ice Age simply meant a period of cooling experienced over the latter half of the Common Era."
,"“Mini” Ice age was indeed a period of a couple hundred years before or just at the beginning of the industrial revolution and only looking at that and modern history could lead you to believe that there’s recency bias or as you put it “exaggeration” so let’s test this idea...

If the arbitrary normal is too low due to the mini ice age then the temperature today shouldn’t be too far off from ones before the mini ice age. Maybe temperatures have always moved up this dramatically after a mini ice age. 

•First piece of evidence we should consider:

-11,300 year reconstruction of global temperatures https://www2.bc.edu/jeremy-shakun/Marcott%20et%20al.,%202013,%20Science.pdf

Amongst many of the graph you will find a temperature reconstruction of the past 2000 years and you can see -within the margin of error- that things were pretty stable for the most part, temperatures were on a cooling trend and then bam that past 200 years happened. 

You can see an even more dramatic spike for the last 11,000 years graph. We are at the warmest point without reasonable doubt.

And it’s not all that surprising given the known physics of gases like Carbon Dioxide. 

When it comes to just the past 2000 years there have been no evidence that the earth have been going through warming at a global scale quite like we are having today: - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1401-2.epdf?referrer_access_token=F9sdV9BseeXqNm0yATLaJNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OFAuvUf3smNPgQh_x6w3tkX-JXRoLf0zBLgBVwxe-KouP-4idIf_fQCqBL7TMNJ6lz_Upqg2JPT8XRijMO8NcwpRWaCn7xCz_mExE1_4wsNqah9D65ox91KY5DFM4b1TjamqrHXlBj8ERmf9roM7VEtB8Dk4GuXW9Uk0FDpdzYgpfQin3T657dwNMpVX2rTOi5250wMPQ8lJY-GUJMfviMV4200fsoRqSnI1p6YiKxu-o-w5fqP9a5ON64ASrV2Ww%3D&tracking_referrer=www.scientificamerican.com"

Why? If anything couldn't one reach the exact opposite conclusion? If it was cooling then why wouldn't we expect the cooling trend to continue? (Making the warming seem all the more anomalous) The problem is that *this is completely fallacious reasoning to begin with*. We could draw a baseline anywhere and use the same argument to make the opposite conclusion! *One cannot draw any predictive power from the arbitrary ""return to normal"" reasoning, thus why it is irrelevant.*

"Warming waters cited as ""key culprit"" in mass die-off of Alaska snow crabs",
,"Climate change is a prime suspect in a mass die-off of Alaska's snow crabs, experts say, after the state took the unprecedented step of canceling their harvest this season to save the species.

According to an annual survey of the Bering Sea floor carried out by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, estimates for the crustaceans' total numbers fell to about 1.9 billion in 2022, down from 11.7 billion in 2018, or a reduction of about 84 percent.

For the first time ever, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced the Bering Sea snow crab season will remain closed for 2022-23, saying in a statement efforts must turn to ""conservation and rebuilding given the condition of the stock."" The state's fisheries produce 60% of the nation's seafood.


The species is also found in the more northward Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, but they do not grow to fishable sizes there.

Erin Fedewa, a marine biologist with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, told AFP the shocking numbers seen today are the result of heatwaves in 2018 and 2019.

The ""cold water habitat that they need was virtually absent, which suggests that temperature is really the key culprit in this population decline,"" she said.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Alaska is the fastest warming state in the country, and is losing billions of tons of ice each year — critical for crabs that need cold water to survive. 

""Environmental conditions are changing rapidly,"" Ben Daly, a researcher with ADF&G, told CBS News. ""We've seen warm conditions in the Bering Sea the last couple of years, and we're seeing a response in a cold adapted species, so it's pretty obvious this is connected. It is a canary in a coal mine for other species that need cold water.""

Historically an abundant resource in the Bering Sea, their loss is considered a bellwether of ecological disruption.

There are thought to be several ways that warmer temperatures have depleted the species.

Studies have pointed toward a higher prevalence of Bitter Crab Disease as the temperature heats up.

The crustaceans, named for their love of cold water, are also under greater metabolic stress in warmer waters, meaning they need more energy to stay alive.

""A working hypothesis right now is that the crabs starved, they couldn't keep up with metabolic demands,"" said Fedewa.

Young snow crabs in particular need low temperatures to hide out from their major predator, Pacific cod, and temperatures in regions where juveniles typically reside jumped from 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2017 to 3.5 Celsius in 2018 (35 degrees Fahrenheit to 38 degrees Fahrenheit) — with studies indicating 3C might be an important threshold.

More research is underway and findings should be published soon, but in the meantime, ""everything really points to climate change,"" Fedewa said.

""These are truly unprecedented and troubling times for Alaska's iconic crab fisheries and for the hard-working fishermen and communities that depend on them,"" Jamie Goen, executive director of Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers said in a statement, lamenting that second and third generation crab-fishing families ""will go out of business.""

The industry was also hit by the cancellation of Bristol Bay red king crab fishing for the second year in a row.

Fedewa also noted that overfishing isn't a big factor in the population collapse of snow crabs.

Fishing removes only large adult males, she said, ""and we've seen these declines across all sizes of snow crab, which really suggest some bottom-up environmental driver is at play.""

Male Alaska snow crabs can reach six inches (15 centimeters) in shell width, but females seldom grow larger than three inches, according to NOAA.

In some good news, this year's survey saw significant increases in the immature crabs compared to last year — but it will take four or five years before the males among them grow to fishable size.

Following the heatwave years, temperatures have returned to normal, and ""the hope is that leaving crabs untouched will allow them to reproduce, there'll be no mortalities, and we can just let the stock try to recover,"" said Fedewa.

Gabriel Prout, whose Kodiak Island fishing business relies heavily on the snow crab population, told CBS News that there needs to be a relief program for fisherman, similar to programs for farmers who experience crop failure, or communities affected by hurricanes or flooding.

When asked what fishermen can do in this situation, with their livelihoods dependent on the ocean, Prout responded, ""Hope and pray. I guess that's the best way to say it."""

That graph is of reported disasters. Note that the line is flat until the International Geophysical Year of 1957 when a concerted effort was made to place tracking stations globally. Then the slope rises gradually as surface stations are placed. Then comes 1978 with the first tracking satellites and the number rises rapidly. Now that sufficient numbers of tracking devices are in place such that no storm is missed the slope is once again flat.

Global deaths from natural disaster 1900-2020 - https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-from-natural-disasters

and deaths per decade - https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/04/Global-annual-death-rate-from-natural-disasters-01.png

These snippets from the AR5 Executive Summary:

 - Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate variability (including phenomena such as El Niño), and natural decadal or multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop for anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide variety of natural weather and climate extremes would still occur. [3.1

 - A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes, and can result in unprecedented extremes. Changes in extremes can also be directly related to changes in mean climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected to lie within the tails of present-day conditions. Nevertheless, changes in extremes of a climate or weather variable are not always related in a simple way to changes in the mean of the same variable, and in some cases can be of opposite sign to a change in the mean of the variable. Changes in phenomena such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation or monsoons could affect the frequency and intensity of extremes in several regions simultaneously.

So even the IPCC says that there is no uptick in disasters and that those that do occur can be attributed to natural processes. Calamitous weather has always occurred and is a normal.part of climate."

,"Except the summary of that Special Report \[1\] that you cherry picked your quotes from is that some weather events have already become more extreme and will continue to do so. The reason isn't attributed to natural processes at all. The IPCC clearly states that it is due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.

For instance

>There is evidence from observations gathered since 1950 of change in some extremes. It is very likely that there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days and nights, and an overall increase in the number of warm days and nights, at the global scale, that is, for most land areas with sufficient data \[...\] Globally, in many (but not all) regions with sufficient data there is medium confidence that the length or number of warm spells or heat waves has increased since the middle of the 20th century. It is likely that there have been statistically significant increases in the number of heavy precipitation events (e.g., 95th percentile) in more regions than there have been statistically significant decreases, but there are strong regional and subregional variations in the trends \[edited for formatting issue\]

As to the cause

>There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It is likely that anthropogenic influences have led to warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale \[...\]  It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic influence on increasing extreme coastal high water due to an increase in mean sea level

Which doesn't necessarily mean his article is incorrect - I do certainly think his point about using food crops to produce fuel for our SUV's is valid - but it does mean I am disinclined to spend any more time checking his 'facts'. 

Also, your argument seems to be that we would be better living with climate change than abandoning our technological civilisation, which, while debatable, is not an argument anybody else is making. We are saying that we will need to adapt to a world where we emit less CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. And as you rightly point out, we are adaptable. We can do this without joining the Amish."
,">And yet, the death rates from extreme weather events fell drastically since 1920s. This is a fact, check the data yourself. It seems that technology and civilization makes the world safer for humans, not more dangerous.

>By affordable and reliable energy sources I mean dense, cheap and uninterrupted, so no, not ""renewables"".

Renewables (wind/solar) already produce a major part of electricity consumption in some countries, so arguably it is affordable. Example countries : Germany, Denmark (check ourworldindata). It's also clear that costs have come down.

To my knowledge, adoption hasn't so far caused unreliability in Denmark or Germany. I've read more about Texas having issues with their power grid. And what makes Texas special? It's a very isolated grid, contrary to Denmark and Germany.

And no, you actualy missed my point. I am not arguing to abandon our technological civilisation to live with climate change. I am arguing for adapting to climate change in the way our technological civilisation does best - by lifting people from poverty by ensuring cheap, plentiful, affordable energy sources, including fossil fuels and nuclear energy, so vehemently criticized by extreme environmentalists movements. This is argument made by many, not only me. This way we can easily adapt and not only survive but thrive through climate change. With the policies being proposed now, the energy prices will skyrocket, bringing energy poverty, slowing economy and progress."
,">And what makes Texas special? It's a very isolated grid, contrary to Denmark and Germany.

I have lived in Texas all my life so know the climate and politics well. It has an isolated electric grid and although that was part of the problem, it was not the main problem. Texas has a substantial wind energy production the makes a sizable contribution to electrical production. But it is seasonal and is small during the winter months. For that reason it was not producing much electricity when the outages began during the ice storm and it was not being used as a primary energy source by ERCOT ( the Texas management system). The problem was the gas lines froze up and coal piles were too wet right when maximum electricity and maximum residential heating was needed. This caused a cascading effect when power stations started dropping offline as generation was unable to keep up with the requirements. The same thing happened in 2011. A federal report investigated the problem at that time and found the grid needed to be winterized. But the Texas government recommended the changes instead of requiring the changes and since Texas has a competitive system no one spent the extra money to make the changes.  
  
Texas has an independent electric grid because they do not what to be regulated by the federal government. Since the grid does not cross state lines they can avoid regulation. At this time Texas has still only changed slightly the requirements to winterize and if another storm happens like before will probably have the same problem.  
  
I live in the small part of Texas that is just outside the regulation of ERCOT. As a result my electric provider is regulated by the federal government which requires their grid to be winterized. We never lost power during that whole time.    


A survey by the Univ of Houston showed only 14% of Texans were willing to pay an extra $10 a month to winterize the electric grid."

Yes but our best bet is to focus just as much on reducing our use than in spending more money to get more water and to keep using it inefficiently.

We should make sure this disaster is going to be the easiest on us it can be and that is to start reducing carbon. Most of the carbon ever emitted was in the last 30 years. Like we are actively trying our best to make it worse. Also the level of climate denial is staggering and climate apathy is almost as bad. In two of the most important places, the US and Brazil, elected straight up climate deniers to power. We are probably completely fucked but yes I also agree we need infrastructure, but if people don't care, they don't care."
,">Yes but our best bet is to focus just as much on reducing our use than in spending more money to get more water and to keep using it inefficiently.

""just as much"" yes!  But from everything I hear concerning our plans we are only focusing on the carbon capture/reduction side of things which as I mentioned won't mitigate the immediate danger to population centers.  That is my worry."
,Edit: Man made carbon ever emitted.
,"Fair. I'm worried because immediate pressing water needs are rather more obvious and easy to see than global climate change, and can raise capital and attention very quickly. Global climate change is a rather different beast to handle, which is what worries me a bit.

At the end of the day, so long as every problem has some people dedicated to taking care of it, that's good :)"
,"I totally understand the concern about potable water… Luckily, the water solution is fortunately already there, it’s just expensive and poor nations will (as always) suffer the first and most. Desalination is as viable as it gets, barring the price. The goal is to find a cheaper option.

But make no mistake, *when* the time comes for global water shortages (which is further off than typical redditors with IQs of 305 will tell you)."

Melting ice is releasing viruses trapped for thousands of years while more humid/subtropical climates that are occurring provide breeding grounds for harmful bacteria and disease spreading mosquitoes. These are the most dangerous effects of the current climate crisis,
,Which virus in particular is especially threatening?
,"While this can be a threat, [Ice Age Ecologist Jacquelyn Gill](https://twitter.com/JacquelynGill/status/1096838985014562822?s=09) covered this recently on what could be expected from this stuff and why!"
,Maybe this will help with our overpopulation problem.
,Is it bad if I root for the viruses?
,I'd worry less about ancient viruses and more about new ones. Like Ebola for example.
,"New ice age



The US is currently drilling a new ice core (see here), already at 1,512 meters where it is 7,700 years old, that is dated absolutely by counting annual ice layers, and each layer will be analyzed for temperature, greenhouse gases, and other constituents. This will give us the best Antarctic record yet. I believe the results will confirm the above. We geologists owe it to policy-makers to give them the benefit of our longer-term perspective. I believe we will regret regulating CO2, since doing so will not produce any measurable climate control, and may actually cause great harm to world economies. If we want to promote renewable energy sources (and I do), let us not penalize fossil fuel production and use.  We may soon need all the energy we can produce, if the long-term cooling continues.
My main point is that natural variation is so large, even if we cease all emissions completely, the climate will still change (just look at the graphs). The cost of (possibly) slightly influencing this change is so great, why not spend a lot less adapting to it? Since we don’t know if the long-term climate is cooling or warming (I bet on cooling long-term), we could spend trillions to cut emissions, only to have the climate cool catastrophically on its own. What then? Pump as much CO2 into the air as possible?
Warming is not a killer, but global cooling is. It would only take a few years of global crop failures from cold weather to put populations at serious risk. Both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are thickening: Leave anything on the ice, and it gets buried pretty fast (for example: the US South Pole Base was recently reconstructed because the old base was being crushed by snow and ice, and WWII planes lost on Greenland’s southeast coast, were covered by 264 feet of ice in 50 years: see the image below). This is not rocket science. Sure, the sea-level edges are retreating (that is why we call them the ablation zones of a glacier), but they represent a minute portion of the continent-scale ice mass."

,"I'm pretty sure the only one that can actually effect humans is Spanish flu in northern Europe regions.

These viruses are not really made for humans, and I doubt they'd survive temps down south. I'm pretty sure this idea that an ancient supervirus exists is wrong. I've yet to see a peer reviewed study or anything of the likes about it, it's all headlines from vox and shitty scientific journalists. I'm not really worried about it. I am more worried about ocean acidification, although that also has many solutions.


Edit: I'd also like to point out, that the issue is MAINLY diseases we have seen before that are frozen inside of dead animals for example. When the permafrost melts this all gets released. It happened with anthrax in russia. Its more about dead things in permafrost being re-released than it is about a new virus. There's not something hidden inside the melted Arctic ice, it's from dead animals thawing in the permafrost.

EDIT2: The real issue (that this article DOES state) is that more places will be vulnerable to malaria and other similar diseases. But new diseases currently aren't an issue. And for the permafrost to FULLY melt it will take several thousand years."
,The one that makes your dick fall off
,Ooh there's also an explanation for why anthrax specifically is popping up! Awesome thread.
,I don't think so! I'll be rooting for them too.
,"This is referring to the Arctic, not Antarctica. Also, 100s of fires are burning as we speak, blazing across 1.2 million acres in the last 10 days alone releasing more ghg emissions than Sweden annually. Read something. [fires burning through arctic](https://mashable.com/article/arctic-fires-alaska-2019/?europe=true)"
,"In fact, Antarctica is melting faster than normal and much faster than scientist predicted.  I learned this from reading peer-reviewed scientific journals. Worse yet, new satellite data suggests that giant lakes are forming under the ice which will, in all likelihood, create the conditions for more melting."
,The Spanish Flu is really the only one I’m worried about since its plague came fast and died out just as quick that we didn’t even create a vaccine for it so we don’t even know how to fight it
,Sounds scary
,"Arctic fires aren’t unusual, tho June hit a high"
,So yeah that's bad but I'd like to point out a caveat - Sweden hardly emits anything at all. Even most of their ferry's are carbon neutral.

,"Could be bad, but there's a thread I saw that actually sorta disproves what I said."
,not sure why you were downvoted you are correct
,Dumping trillions and trillions of oil into the air has absolutely no impact on the atmosphere.
,"You see kids, if scientists make their best estimate of when certain effects of man-made climate warming can be expected to happen, then those things don't happen exactly when predicted, then there obviously is no such thing as man-made climate warming."
,Good luck with that kind of skepticism. Stay strong.
,"So now we not only dump carbon into the air but oil to. It’s as if we don’t understand what fuel, combustion and products of combustion are."
Honest question: Why does the public not get what’s happening and about to come?,"Just reported that CA biggest water resources are at critical levels. Lake Powell, the Grand Canyon of water is now taking drastic measures to conserve water. Pakistan is in a collapse because they literally have no water. India will lose an astronomical amount of wheat harvest this year.

My partner and I are making long term plans based on the environment and I just can’t fathom why people are not discussing this more?! 

I get there are hundreds of things going on in the news but it seems like humanity is really only 1-3 years away from that breaking frantic point. 

What is it?!

I feel like I’m the crazy one with everyone I know saying Um did you all see like the daily articles on some serious water crisis starting or the death of a lot of animals, the forest fires starting much earlier than ever before, hell where are all the insects now?"
,People don’t like to think about it because it overwhelms them and they feel helpless and they feel depressed when they think about it.
,"I wondered that, and then saw how seriously people and governments took Covid until their world came crashing down (I'm in India and almost everyone i know here lost some relative/ family member to Covid). If people can take a crisis this close and with precautions relatively harmless (masks, vaccines) not seriously until they get wrecked do you think they'll care about the climate collapse that still hasn't drastically affected them ? In the third world many don't even know about this, and are more worried about their immediate needs . 
The world will only care when nothing can be done anymore."
,"I feel you, I study this stuff. But fossil fuel companies etc have done a brilliant job convincing people it’s not a big deal and all us scientists are just alarmists. Even many people that still believe in it think its so far away it won’t affect them or their kids. Chance’s are the shit is gonna hit the fan in only a few decades (let’s be honest it’s already begun for many but rich westerners have been sheltered from the worst). Unfortunately I think many won’t want to act until it’s an apocalyptic scenario on their back doorstep, by which time it will be far too late to change anything."

,"The average person doesn’t care. They think unseasonably warm autumns and mild winters are ‘lovely’. People are so detached from their food systems that they just complain about the 20% price hike because the cause of the change is intangible to them.

The movie ‘don’t look up’ is an amazing metaphor for how distracted we are and how little bandwidth most people have for this stuff.

Maybe dry lakes in CA is what it’s going to take to kickoff real change?"
,"I think it is the wiring. We are wired for quick fixes and instant rewards. Not for long term planning and consideration. Just like bacteria. It makes sense, because we evolved unable to understand the really big picture. And if we thought it was better somewhere else, it was easy to move. Lots of unclaimed land everywhere and no borders.

To overrule our instincts takes effort. So unless the danger is NOW, we just don't care. Most of us. 

We are all descendants from a long, long line of survivors. And most of them did as we do now. Stay put and do your thing until imminent immediate danger. Then flee somewhere else, unless it is something you can kill."
,I’m right there with you. Terrified and baffled.
,"Just curious, what are you and your partner doing as far as long term planning? I have thought about this and would like some advice for my family."
,"People feel like they can’t do anything. But it’s not true. I think it’s about the mindset. Focusing on the small things and the positive things help. People need to be educated and encouraged to care. I think a lot more people do care.

,"It’s kind of like telling someone that they have an incurable disease.

They’re used to letting the system take care of everything and they have no idea what to do when they realize the system isn’t working. Here’s a tip: call your senators.

in sci fi there are sometimes parallel universes, and sometimes things are a heck of a lot worse than in the ""regular"" timeline that you see, which of course you tend to view as the ""right"" one... like, in this one alternate timeline, the Borg are everywhere! and i will never forget when i finally realized, we do not live in the right timeline, we live in one of the bad alternate ones. but schools in the US definitely teach kids an impression (or did when i was growing up) that we're in the good timeline -  at least in this country. 

edit: plus there are unfortunate psychological mechanisms in humans... like if things sound TOO awful and scare us too much, we decide we can't do anything so we just give up, and some people, who are born optimists, mainly just push it out of their mind, i think. and then there's the people who just pay no attention to the news at all... and then there's the people who assume technology will save us somehow..."

,"Most of the public chooses to believe things that make them feel warm and fuzzy, as opposed to acknowledging hard facts.  Then there is the profit motive.  Conservatives generally don’t want any change and certainly no plans for future progress.  Many religions teach that our fate is sealed anyway, so why bother?  If one believes that an omnipotent being controls everything, then one will submit to the outcomes instead of fighting trends and trying to steer the ship oneself.

I think the media is pushing an agenda that people don't care. the oil is pushing that they aren't going anywhere. the govt doesn't seem to really care. but if you look around on your daily travels you'll notice the change. it's slow but picking up momentum even if the giants don't want it people do.

In 1858, the entire city of London smelt like a big pile of shit.

It was worse than any Indian slum in history.

But we got over it.

That seems significant, and when dinosaurs roamed the earth CO^2 was at 1400p/ ml.
We are below 400p/ml. . I'm disappointed with the environmental scientist s modeling.

,This is the answer
,"Well we’re still planning but a few things and of course please google and if you or anyone has conflicting info please share. This is based on what I’ve researched online. I have reviewed a ton of “what states will be the best in climate change.” I am by no means an expert but this is what I’ve found.

Water is of course the most valuable resource. There are only a select few states that have first use water rights. Meaning if you own a house on land that has water on it, you have first right use to that, in effect you own the water. Of course this will be changed in the future but a lot of states you can’t even collect rain water. 

From what we’ve researched Michigan is the place to go. It’s super cheap right now (hellish winters though) but they have first use water rights and you can get a lot of land for cheap too, but most websites list Michigan on the top places to live for resources, location, Lower risk of forest fires, etc. we’ve also consider New York. 

That said we are also considering out of country for personal political and climate change reasons. 

I’m trying to research climate proof careers for maybe a career change. We’ve also decided to cut back on our spending, etc kind of treating now as a time to cut back so we can save. Food prices will go up, water will go up in price, etc so kind of prepping ahead of time and of course if we are wrong great we have extra money. 

We’re also considering vehicles with more options for repair (meaning more parts out there, etc). Not because we think it will go Mad Max but because I dont think people consider the economic impact as much as the climate impact. 

A few ideas. If anyone has anything else would love to hear it!"
,"get to know your neighbors. get to be able to trust your neighbors and work together with them. keep building that trust.

get a water tank and grey water system. grow drought-tolerant food.

learn to forage.

get solar panels.

teach your kids to get by without buying stuff. 

start a grocery buyers club with your neighbors and family where you all put in for bulk foods from restaurant supply stores.

learn to repair things for yourselves and for other people. 

get first aid training.

make specific plans for when and how and where you'll evacuate to in case of wildfire, flood, tornado, and civil unrest.

stay healthy and fit.

look out for each other."
,"I think we have to cultivate a culture of compassion around this issue. Trying your best is enough, and literally, all we can do. If you're poor and living paycheck to paycheck, maybe voting for green measures and speaking up on behalf of the environment with your peers is all you can do. If you can donate to the NRDC and put solar panels on your house, great. If you can run for office on a green platform or work in green tech, amazing. Every little thing helps in the fight for the future, no matter how small. We can be cynical about it or ruthlessly pragmatic. If that ten extra kilograms of CO2 doesn't enter the atmosphere, maybe some kid in the future will enjoy an extra meal of lentils that survived the scorching summer heat in fifty years, saving them one extra day from starvation and fear. We push the crisis back, little by little, with pure grit."
,That makes sense. It does feel like everyone around me doesn’t care or even think twice about it because it’s like it will just work out.
,"We are unfortunately in the only timeline there is, the one where Hillary almost won, but somehow didn't.

,">and then there's the people who just pay no attention to the news at all... and then there's the people who assume technology will save us somehow...

,"Even though we know desalination, it’s still not yet on a grand scale of being able to supply all that water as majority of that is undrinkable for humans. If this were the case countries like Pakistan wouldn’t be freaking out right now about water. I mean hell, countries with droughts and people dying from no water would never be a thing if that’s the case"
,"Oh there have been billions of panics in history. But I live life based on probability. Unlike anytime in history including 1900s, we have booming population numbers, an industrial complex beyond the industrial revolution as far as chemicals to waste to gases, we have more cars, less forests, resources are needed increasingly more and more as both humans get born and technology grows and so far we are out pacing our ability to help regrowth. So it’s just logic. 

For instance, I was in a start up company of 100+ with a executives who sold companies before. January 2019 I was already telling them that this “Covid” that’s occurring in other countries will be a game changer and we need to prep. I said this because the rate and exposure at that point outside of the US was greater than we had seen in decades. By early March I was only one of 3 in the entire office trying to tell them. End of March they did a remote stay at home saying it would be two weeks. I laughed, it was easily going to be six months to a year at least. 

The reason because of probability and logic. I wasn’t afraid of it though I took it serious, I just looked at the whole picture. The world was already shutting down before the US which would have a economic and psychological trickle effect that would majorly change things even if Covid left quickly. Then when it hit the US, the sheer amount of people getting sick and staying home was unprecedented which means it will effect all channels of life. 

I also live off the rule that I can and will be and always have a chance at being wrong. Cross checking is super important. I use the above example as why I ask these things. 

Do I think the world will blow up anytime soon, no most likely not but will prices for water increase as demand grows and supply lowers, yes, it’s just simple economics. Will greed always be at the forefront of companies and billionaires selfishly taking advantage, always. So we continue a path where the supply lowers and demand is growing. 

So it boggles my mind because it’s just compounding evidence. The adage of “this always happens or cycles” is no longe true. My home state has had unprecedented forest fires and that’s not the only state. Countless lakes and water resources are reaching dangerously low levels (dangers meaning you may be fine today still but next year is the worry). Animals are in fact dying off at a large rate. Heat levels are higher across the board.

It’s not like on single country or state is having issues, it’s across the board. So It’s more the thing of using your examples and every state and country now having their own tragedies environmentally than a few here or there.

I’m not saying panic but wisdom and just logic. 

Hell, if the public was aware they would probably realize things like buying cheaper homes in areas of high water resources and colder temps that are now turning warmer is a very smart investment as the population grows housing gets more expensive nearly everywhere so worst case is you break even or make a little bit of money but most likely you will make money in the next five years buying in a place like this. 

It’s all encompassing ya know."

,It’s also worth noting that local politics are more effective in the short term than any national scale activation.

,"Totally agree, I find it very difficult. At work they have no option for recycling, I reuse plastic cups for water throughout the day and recycle cardboard boxes for art projects. I push for recycling and people think I’m crazy. I will say even though green alternatives tend to be more expensive and inaccessible when you make that investment it lasts in the long run rather than having to buy the same thing over again. For example getting reusable containers or bags you won’t have to produce those products and in the long run reusing them will save money and resources. But living paycheck to paycheck it is hard to make that investment when the latter option is more feasible."

Oh, it absolutely has to do with the better availability of nutrition, which in turn was made possible by the same things causing climate change, but in this case, I think the crux of the argument around climate change and what to do about it has to acknowledge that yes, fossil fuels and factory farming allowed many to have better and easier access to food, but we have also developed (and continue to develop) greener, cleaner ways to feed and house people, and should not assume we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater."

,">More great news to fuel my existential dread.

Having ""existential dread"" means you, unlike most, understand that life has no inherent meaning. Now you need to create some meaning to your existence else you'll be condemned to a life of meaningless suffering.

Arthur Schopenhauer also believed life had no inherent meaning which caused us suffering but saw two paths to relieve that suffering: to live life as an ascetic and to pursue an interest in the creative arts.

He freely admitted that a life of asceticism wasn't practical for most. While this is true a life of minimalism is not only practical it lower our carbon footprint and be an example for others to follow. Minimalism is good for both the planet and ourselves in both physical and psychological ways.

The other path Schopenhauer spoke about was to find joy in the creative arts. When one is in the state of creativity one is in a state of ""flow"" or in Taoist terms ""wúwéi"" (effortless action). It is a place where no ""existential dread"" can enter.

The climate change crisis is frightening and is going to quickly change our world. To survive we as a people need to adapt. While many look to the ""heavens above"" for help those that have ""existential dread"" know that all our answers for salvation lie within us. Those answers are minimalism and finding joy within ourselves.

Practice minimalism and create something that will help all those people still asleep through the troubles ahead that we can and we must change.

Good luck."

What if this crisis could lead us to a more equitable and happier world? 

Climate change is of course here and real. The best course of action is to greatly reduce our carbon foot print which would not only benefit mankind physically but done correctly could also benefit us psychologically. 

The single-family home and suburbs have to go for too many reasons to list. Replace them with low energy cohousing communities where residents share common faculties including EVs and also share an evening meal together. Hire a chef (preferably also a resident) and the rest of the kitchen staff are volunteers. Working late and can't make the meal? No problem, we'll leave you a take-away bag for you in your 'fridge for when you get home. Everyone gets a lower carbon footprint and a meal with friends. This is currently being done around the world with great success.

I am saddened by the climate change crisis. My last home and neighborhood will be uninhabitable due to rising sea levels in my son's lifetime. The same for the home and neighborhood I grew up in during his son's lifetime. But I can also see how this crisis could finally create the change needed to resolve the inequity and alienation Marx and so many others warned us about. I don't have a lot of hope but enough.

,"Bud, there's nothing to refute. It's an outdated figure, and it's an \*estimate\*. Things are looking a lot worse now. Also, 5% is not ""tiny"". The US hasn't seen a 5% reduction in GDP since 1946 and 1932. The 2008-2009 recession was only a 2.5% reduction in GDP.

EDIT

Three years ago the US issued it's own report that estimated a 10% GDP reduction: [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/climate/us-climate-report.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/climate/us-climate-report.html)

,"But to play devil's advocate, 5% is tiny and I don't have a good counter number/stats for it? 

I could argue that 5% reduction in 30 years is quite large due to the fact that exponential progress should at least double the GDP by 2050, if not for climate change. But then again I have no way of backing this up since I am no economist. 

I'm just looking for a good, solid counter to this 5% narrative."
,"hmm, maybe IPCC were too conservative with the estimate. 

Plus a GLOBAL 5% average reduction means some places could have much higher reduction and it also means year after year reduction, which would devastate future economy beyond rebound for a long time, which would logically create a negative feedback loop that destroys the economy and any expensive effort to fund climate repair. This is how I see it now, but I'm not sure if this is enough to convince the climate skeptics. Its hard to accurately predict so far into the future. 30 years is a long time."
,"That's not playing devil's advocate, that's pushing a specific opinion that ""5% of the global GDP, spread unevenly among all nations, is a tiny fraction and won't lead to any significant change"" as a fact.

Like I said, someone pushing their opinion as fact isn't going to have any meaningful discussion, and no argument or evidence is going to make any difference.

Edit: But, if you really want to push it, 5% is huge. This isn't cumulative, this is annual. To put it into perspective, in a great economic year, the United States GDP grows by around 4% and on average grows at about 2%, and the 2008 recession was about -3% GDP rate. At 5% annual cost, that would put the GDP negative permanently."

lol  you could have said this in the beginning, I was trying so hard to dig for it. 

Basically it means for the first time in history of GDP, the entire world is suffering negative GDP and its 5% annually, which means its compounding, which means it could be 30% reduction by 2056. Am I getting this right? 

But what about total GDP? Wouldnt it be huge by 2050? Would this not offset the 5% reduction? I'm a bit confused."
,"No, the only thing that matters in a stable economy is the rate of growth. To put it in perspective, the 2008 recession was globally one of the worst downturns since the Great Depression, yet the GDP at that time was many times higher than most periods of flourishing."
,"No, this is not correct. The person you replied to is also incorrect - it does not imply negative global GDP. The 5% hit to GDP is unrealized wealth. GDP will continue to grow but there will be costs associated with climate change potentially amounting to 5% of GDP.

For example, today's global GDP is 80T. Many economists believe this figure could double by 2050. In that scenario it is then 160T. But say these economists poorly estimated the costs of climate change which amounted to 5% of GDP growth over that time. The world GDP Is then 152T. This would be 8T in unrealized global wealth and it would be cumulative each year. The correct economic decision would be the policy that results in the lowest total when adding the cost of climate change + cost of mitigation. William Nordhaus won a Nobel Prize for his work on this topic and there are many summaries of his research out there if you want to learn more. Bjorn Lomborg also discusses this concept extensively. 

To get back to you initial point that some would consider this ""tiny"". That's a complicated question as you would have to weight it against any costs related to avoiding that outcome. Mitigation policy that impacts growth too much would be counter productive. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle."
,"hmm, this sounds better, which means a GLOBAL 5% average reduction would devastate the economy to the point of no rebound, ever?"
,"You're probably right. For some reason, I was stuck thinking annual GDP growth, and got frustrated because they were no longer playing devils advocate and just kept repeating the same point."
,"Wow, thank you for this, but this still doesn't answer the core of my question, is this a big problem or is it insignificant?   


and perhaps more importantly, is GDP even the right measure of climate damage? Could GDP be great while billions are suffering due to climate change? Is this probable? 

My main concern is people keep using this 5% meme to say climate change is peanuts and not worth dealing with, are they right?"
,"Never is a long time. And there's a reason why the reports use phrasing such as ""very likely"" and ""unlikely""."
,"Yeah - I don't think calling it tiny is very convincing given that it would be trillions of dollars annually. On the other hand, it doesn't really say much at all without the context that both climate change and climate change mitigation have a cost and impact to GDP and both are cumulative."
,"So what you are getting at is - in my opinion - the core question of the entire climate change discussion. That is to say, there is a LOT unknown but the economics of it is what I believe needs to drive our decision making. I'm happy to provide some thoughts but I would definitely suggest you to check out the two people I mentioned in the prior comment if you want opinions on the topic that are smarter than mine.

> is this a big problem or is it insignificant?

It depends who you ask and it is all relative to the alternatives. There is a lot of disagreement about the economic implications of climate change. There is agreement that it will cost money but that is about where it ends. How much will it cost, how much of that cost can we prevent, and how much will that prevention cost are difficult questions to answer but they are all fundamental to answering your question. I think GDP is the correct/most useful measurement but arriving at high confidence predictions is easier said than done.

> Could GDP be great while billions are suffering due to climate change? Is this probable?

I would say improbable but only to the extent that we have seen immense wealth creation during the past century and suffering still exists. By many important measures (extreme poverty, malnutrition, child mortality, illiteracy, etc) we have seen huge reductions in suffering and I don't think it is unreasonable to expect those trends to continue.

> My main concern is people keep using this 5% meme to say climate change is peanuts and not worth dealing with, are they right?

They may be right but if they don't explain it *relative to the cost of mitigation* they don't understand the why behind the ""5% meme"". That said, I think they are likely *closer* to being right than wrong. That isn't to say I don't think we should be taking action to reduce our emissions. I believe we should. There are many reasons to pursue cleaner energy sources but we need to be mindful about any cost that has on human flourishing."

,"Ok, what about climate change is trivial and we'll probably be fine by 2100? Even if we do nothing?"
,"I don't think so because it still has to be considered *relative* to the cost of action. 5% unrealized GDP is already non-trivial. IF that cost is less than the cost of mitigation - while taking in to account *what portion can actually be mitigated* - then I think you could make an argument that it's something closer to a non-issue than an emerging catastrophe but you'd have to show your work to make a compelling case.

Also important to recognize that impact will not be uniform. There are billions of people without access to reliable energy. The single greatest thing that could be done to prepare these people for a changing climate is, ironically, providing them access to inexpensive reliable energy."

But no sir, all of the current 10 hottest years on record have been since 2009. The top 5 hottest years have all been since 2015 (meaning that the last 5 years are the top 5 hottest years on record) and the top 35 were the last 35. If that doesn't sound like a trend to you I don't know what does."
Renewables generated more electricity than coal for the first time in US history,

Microsoft to invest $1 billion in carbon capture with pledge to go carbon-negative by 2030,
,Ten years ago
,"The innovators and leaders who emerge and successfully address this problem should have a memorial to them like Mount Rushmore, so all future generations will know who saved their asses.

If they manage to invent and build something that actually pulls enough CO2 from the air, their names and deeds should *never* be forgotten."
,"This is pretty good - if a little late. Just watched the whole video and sounds good (if they can pull it off). A large part of their strategy to achieve this goal is based on carbon capture and some not yet existing technologies. 

Microsoft also joined a group in May 2019 that seeks legal immunity for oil giants for damages caused by climate change. In essence they want to prevent companies being held accountable.

[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-05-02-microsoft-joins-climate-leadership-council](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-05-02-microsoft-joins-climate-leadership-council)

Bravo for this ambitious pledge, but there is more to be done - and a lot to be undone.

They continue to work with and make business with Oil and Gas giants. Microsoft says that they want to help them transition... But whatever the stated reasons are - they are profiting and partnering with companies that have know about climate change for decades and did nothing but launch disinformation campaigns. These companies are only transitioning because of public pressure and instead of supporting them, Microsoft should support other companies that really care about sustainability."
,If you want to actually save the world then put in more billions. I thank the billionaires who realize that they can give away some of their money to try to save us... but I will be truly thankful when billionaires throw everything they have at the problem and actually save us.

,"The truth is the truth, it doesnt change just because you don't want to believe it. The truth is unapologetic, it is simply the truth. By not using your intelligence to actually research beyond everything you're told, you're nothing more than a sheep (i know you are actually more than a sheep, so maybe prove me right). One of the signatories to the 11000 scientists report was from Disney, as per page 203 of the signatory report. https://wfpquantum.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/2019/36931_Climate-emergency-signatory-list.pdf ... Professor Micky Mouse signed, from the Micky Mouse Institute for the Blind (along with all who BLINDly believe in unintentional manmade CC). So you have that name on the list (page 203), together with 70 psychologists, 29 political scientists, 59 renew(energy)ologists, 73 economists and many students of all descriptions (probably the same ones who do the IPCC reports). Also, a unesco report shows more than 8million scientists worldwide. https://en.unesco.org/unesco_science_report/figures ... so we have .001375% of scientists claiming this as a fact. Also, on www.petitionproject.org there are signatories of over 30,000 scientists saying the opposite of these supposed ""climate scientists"". Moreover, as described on www.realclimatescience.com - in an article titled ""listen to the scientists"" it says the following - ""It is important to listen to the scientists.  They are advocating genocide on a scale never before seen on earth, and say that anyone other than themselves lack the qualifications to participate in the discussion about whether or not this genocide should proceed. They say that citizens of the “Land of the Free” need to be excluded from a discussion about their proposal for genocide. This combination of genocidal scientists, their big lie, and demands for censorship occurred several times during the last century, particularly in China, Russia and Germany. These 11,000 scientists should lead by example and remove themselves from the planet.  That would go a tremendous way towards cleaning up the intellectual, political and journalistic environment of the earth. "" furthermore, 100% of Paul Ehrlich’s predictions from the 70's failed, where they were darn sure that global cooling was for sure... I don't blame you for not knowing any of this."

,"Maybe, you'd actually find the speech on youtube if you bothered searching. Bill Gates ACTUALLY said what i quoted, and the only issue is that you blindly refuse to believe it. Manmade intentional climate change is real. As for unintended CC - Not a chance. It is the trojan horse of climate change... what's inside? Red pill for the sheep? Or does the sheep walk blindly to the slaughter? Take Australia's fires - firstly, it's not a natural drought. Cotton farming, along with frack wells (fracking) have depleted Way more water than australian citizens do (up to 15million litres per frack well, and there are over 40,000 of them in Oz). Channel 7 news Brisbane weather outlet reported in October of 2019 - trails of aluminium chaff on the weather map, but this was where the transparency ended - the news outlet went on blame it on a ""military exercise"" because clearly, many countries have been lining up to invade Australia cos we're so ""vulnerable"". Most importantly, chaff/chemtrails were released soon before the bushfires went off in nsw... Barium and strontium are in chaff, and these compounds are also accelerants used for SPARKLERS... watch thecrowhouse on youtube. This manmade climate change crap is utter nonsense and a complete hoax...the great artesian basin (which supplies most rivers and aquifers) is now close to depleted due to fracking (frack wells).. still sure about a ""climate emergency""? Cloud seeding and geoengineering create our ""climate emergencies"". The trojan horse houses Agenda 21/2030 - the manure of the trojan... we are being pushed out of the countryside towards city centres.

Former climate change denier here. This has been the hottest winter I’ve experienced (in Texas). Is this a result of climate change or a coincidence?,"Not being sarcastic. I’ve noticed that, at least in the part of Texas I’m in right now, it’s been in the 80s for most of winter. It got below freezing today, but is expecting to go back into the 80s later this week. I know there’s a difference between weather and climate, but I’ve never seen anything this erratic and weird. Y’all know more than me, so I’m interested in your thoughts."

,"Let's say you alter a 6-sided die so that it rolls 6 more often than it rolls any other number. You roll it and it comes up 6. Did this happen because you altered the die, or would it have happened regardless?

It's impossible to say. However if you roll the die 600 times and it comes up with 6 150 times, then say more confidently that it's likely due to your alteration. But a single event cannot be attributed to a change in probability."
,"Thanks for raising your question here.  Hopefully the answers are helpful.

,"I worked at a ski resort for 10 years and was a patron for 20 years. My first year up there talking to the bosses they had said to me if there's no first snow by Halloween they'd be in trouble. Looking back through old photos and through the history it used to get real snow six months out of the year. 

The season was regularly Halloween through Easter. Great years were beginning of October through end of April sometimes even May. Every year they would be opening 2 weeks give or take later and ending 2 or 3 weeks earlier. My last year of work, my tenth year, the first real snowstorm didn't come until February and the season ended in mid March. Only 2 of those years they had decent snow storms come in, but only like 1 storm week and that was it. They had a reservoir system and blew their own snow. Towards the last year i rode there it was so dry the entire reservoir was empty, there wasn't even enough rain for them to blow their own snow even if they wanted to. It rarely even got below 40f.

It sucks, but i do understand people will not believe things until it affects them directly. The majority of the population likes to remain apathetic, and for many many different reasons."

,"What you are looking for is called attribution science, or the science of extreme event attribution.

It cannot, and does not pretend to, offer definitive, categorical anwsers. Instead, it provides statistical, probabilistic ones.

Which is where skeptics see the opportunity of arguing ""well it's not hard fact, it's not direct causal proof, so it's not science"", an argument that entirely disregard the complexity of climate, and the ensuing epistemological complexity of climate science.

,"This isn't an answer to your question, but the question reminds me of something that happened to me.

I grew up in West Michigan near the Lake Michigan shoreline. When I was a boy, my parents hosted our extended family Christmas parties. In 2019, my parents hosted the extended family Christmas party for the first time in a long time. At the party, we played the family videos, which were primarily videos from previous extended family Christmas party activities from when I was a boy in the 80s & 90s. There were hours of recording, so it was just something for people to watch in between conversations or whatever.

The shocking part is that every single one of those years shows the children playing in feet of snow and sledding down hills with snowmobile tracks. It was such a stark contrast because now there is little or no snow around the holidays every year and you never hear or see snowmobiles in December.

If you are 30+ and grow up where I did it would be hard to deny that there tends to be less snow on the ground than there was when we were younger, but the change over time is so gradual it can be almost imperceptible, but watching those videos taken from my parent's backyard 30ish years ago made that change so tangible."
,"Colorado has been so dry that, in the last 2 years we have had the worst 3 wild fires ever recorded in the last 140 years, and, a historic first ever, post Xmas wild fire that destroyed almost 1000 homes. That has never happened because usually after Thanksgiving there will be snow on the grass. But the grass are so dry this year and that day there was hundred mile winds making the entire city of Boulder a powder keg."

,"Causation is in general a hard question - if you have a variable that if you changed it, something other than what happend would have happened, then if that variable is in the right configuration, did it cause the event. Thinking about causation always involves an estimate of what would've happened if you changed a variable.

Does x cause y? We need to know what would happen if we change x. But, there is only one reality, so working out whether x causes y means we need someone who can estimate what would happen if x wasn't true.

Plus, most things have multiple causes."
,Statistically speaking you can't blame the weather of a single season on climate change as there is too much fluctuation year to year. That being said it certainly fits with the trend of average temperatures increasing over time.
,"If it helps to offer an anecdote, I live in South Louisiana, and have my whole life. I'm 39 years old, and was born in 1982. In my lifetime, it's snowed here I think 7, maybe 8, times. Most of those were before I turned 20. I think only _once_ has it snowed here since then. In my experience, it went from being once every 3-4 years to being once a decade. 

When I was about 6-7 years old, one winter we experienced such a hard freeze that a large pond (~2 acres) near our house was frozen _inches_ thick. So thick that full grown adults could safely walk out onto it. Since then the pond has frozen over a handful of times, but never thick enough to even attempt to walk on it. And maybe only once in the past decade at all.

I met an 80 old man (also from here) a few years ago during a local political campaign, and we got to chatting - climate change came up, and he told me that when he was growing up here in the 1940s, snow may not have been considered a super-common event, but it would snow for a day or two every year, sometimes skipping a year. But what he really marveled at - what made him believe that climate change was a 'Thing' - was the near-total lack of icicles on front porches and the eaves of roofs in the last few decades. He said that in the 1940s and 50s, multiple times a year, _every year,_ there'd be a hard freeze during a storm (usually sleet) that'd cover the eaves and porches of every house with icicles anywhere from an inch to a foot long.

Reverting back now to MY experience, the only time in the past decade that I can remember for sure there were icicles like that (let's face it, icicles aren't as fun and memorable as snow) was this past February, when we got hit by the tail-end of that massive freeze that hit Texas, and shut down their entire power grid. I can't recall any icicles from 2000-2010, either (not ruling them out though).

None of this is overly surprising, considering that one of the major effects of climate change is a disruption in major jetstreams - like last year's freeze was caused by a gigantic pocket of arctic air getting dislodged."

Maybe 60% of it is caused by normal local weather variability, 15% is some unusual upper atmosphere event that is not climate related, 10% is El Nino, and 15% is climate change (just throwing out random percentages as an example of what I mean)

Or you can put it like: if climate change was not here, you still would have had a warm winter, but it wouldn't be quite *this* hot. Those 80°F days would have been 76°F without climate change.

An analogy: weather is like the waves coming up on the beach, while climate is like the tide. Your hot weather spell is like big waves hitting the shoreline. But the highest water levels happen when big waves come in on top of a high tide. Similarly, the hottest winters happens when a hot weather system comes in on top of higher temperatures caused by climate change."
,Thanks Dr. Strange (but no really that’s a good point).
,It was entirely political. I identified as a conservative (still do to some degree) and couldn’t reconcile recognizing the fact of climate change with my overall philosophy.
,"The biggest thing (and this is hard with any pseudo-political issue) is to try your best to not be a dick. Conservatives often have beliefs largely just as a ‘fuck you’ to people they consider to always be talking down to them. It’s what held me back from opening my mind on many issues. Climate change has largely been presented in terms of intelligent people vs. yokels. Recognize the person you’re talking to is likely very competent in some areas and less competent in others, just like yourself, and respectfully tie the issue to things that effect them. For example, I’m originally from Louisiana. Louisiana is losing coastline by the football field per minute, and this is making it incredibly more susceptible to hurricanes, which are also getting more frequent. A lot of people in Louisiana who otherwise identify as conservatives care a LOT about the coastline. That’s an in."
,"There was an erratic collapse of the polar vortex just a few years ago in Jan 2019. The polar vortex cycles air high up in the atmosphere. When the regular flow of air collapsed, it brought cold arctic air to a lot of the world, delivering unusual snowstorms across Europe and a deep freeze across North America including Canada. This kind of erratic behavior is made more likely by this human induced climate emergency we find ourselves in. This weather phenomenon also interestingly played a part in steering hurricane Sandy into the US."
,"Sort of. The jet stream is such a mess that we're getting just a dip from a fractured mass of the artic while Alaska enjoys the upper 60s. You would think the blast we got last year would make one curious enough to delve into what is really happening.All year it's been towns in Germany, China, Brazil, etc. being leveled by floods. Fires like the one that decimated Boulder, CO and other unprecedented events. Not only are the effects of climate change real and present, they're accelerating at an exponential rate now. 

If you are still in denial, I hope you enjoy your final months of blissful ignorance."
,SHIT! As concerned as I am I actually hate the cold lol.
,Polar vortex.
,Not to make light of it but I’m kinda psyched that I’m not freezing my balls off. People don’t think so but Texas gets cold af at times.
,"Maybe.

As the arctic melts there will be a pool of warmer wetter air later into the fall.   The cold spot moves over central Siberia.  

The engine of the jet stream is the temperature differential bewteen the equator and the poles.  As the poles warm up, the jet stream wanders more.  The result is that large masses of very cold air can wander around, following the jet stream much like a St. Bernard chasing a pork chop.

Net result:  We get wildly more variable winters.  You will see more 80 F Christmasses, but also more ""winter from hell"" winters.  (Fix your power grid texas...)"
,"Except that these ‘random incidents’ are happening all over the globe.

,"Great point and something I wish people who accept climate change understood. I work with a couple conservative climate change deniers, who also happen to be much smarter than I am in certain things. One has a math degree and the other is a professional engineer. It would silly of me to call them stupid, when I am the stupid one in their area of expertise. And people on both sides of any issue tend to make caricatures of the people on the other side. Of course this didn’t start with 21st century politics in the US. One could make an argument that our political divide started at least as early as the English Civil War between the Puritans and Loyalists in the 17th century. Which featured its own war on Christmas, of all things. And 200 years later, those same factions fought in the American Civil War."

I would've been more proactive about gobal warming, but honestly us everyday folks can't do anything about it. Most of the waste and carbon emission is produced by industries. Eg. saving a bunch of plastic bags per household and swapping for recyclable paper straws isn't going to do anything when 80% of plastic waste actually comes from the fishing industry."

,"Good observation. And before anyone says, ‘but this is a time-sensitive issue and they need to accept it blah blah blah,’ you’re right, and you owe it to your cause to be good at messaging it.

Lots of climate activists aren't fan of governments either, and they'd rather have a decentralized and spontaneous climate action from all actors, than an authoritarian state-sponsored one.

Are you familiar with game theory and collective action theory?"
,"Maybe.  But not in the US.  I suggest you look up what the Chinese are doing to dominate renewables and electric vehicles.  Then compare that to the discussions in the US.  Half the political spectrum in the US is still coming to grips with climate change being a reality.  This isn't just about climate change as an environmental threat any more.  It's about understanding which industries will be dominant, which countries will gain geopolitical importance as the climate changes, and what is needed to win the 21st century.  Increasingly, it's not looking like American strategic culture can deal with all that, when it's such an uphill [challenge just to convince so many Americans that climate change is real (third in the world on denial behind Indonesia and Saudi Arabia among highly populated countries)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/us-hotbed-climate-change-denial-international-poll).  I genuinely wish the national security wing of the conservative movement had more say.  They seem to be the only conservatives in the US, who truly get this.

There are ins, but to play devil’s advocate, I thought the green new deal would be an in because it framed climate change as an opportunity for places like West Virginia and the Rust Belt.

And when people are greeted by sneers and hate when they try to extend an olive branch, it can seem like a lost cause."

,"> but it was associated with AOC et. al. 

Not sure how to square the circle here.  Only hardcore progressives push these ideas to begin with.  It's not like there will ever be a Republican version of the Green New Deal. 

The interesting part that is coming is the finance and insurance sector simply dropping policies and refusing service to vulnerable places and industries.  I am curious to see how conservatives deal with this.  Can't force the private sector to serve anyone.  And any government program that is not pared with actual mitigation will simply see escalating claims."
,"What do you mean? 

And it seems weird to me that you’re still describing this issue as a left wing cause despite no longer denying the problem exists 

Maybe because you’re American?

Here in the U.K. it’s not particularly a partisan issue. For most developed nations it’s not a partisan debate to acknowledge climate change is a serious issue for humanity"

,"That’s the problem, that only hardcore progressive push these policies. Don’t get me wrong, I had issues with some parts of the Green New Deal, but I think the trajectory we’re hoping for is for conservatives and moderate democrats to start proposing still effective but maybe more tempered bills so there’s a higher chance of things getting done. I think that’s coming. I know of at least one growing conservative-leaning environmental organization (not CFACT or any other cringe). I forget the name, but they’re serious."
,"No I feel you, and you’re right. It’s a non-partisan issue. I’m just saying the tactic of just telling people they should care isn’t an effective way to make them care. They should care, yes, but simply telling them that repeatedly doesn’t work very often."
,Some places - cities - run out of water where they don’t grow crops.
,">I think that’s coming. I know of at least one growing conservative-leaning environmental organization (not CFACT or any other cringe). I forget the name, but they’re serious.

I don't see it.  At least not in the US.  Let's not forget that the conservative approach to cutting emissions was supposed to be exactly what George Bush Sr did on acid rain: pricing pollution.  Either through cap-and-trade or carbon taxes.  Unfortunately, thanks to folks like Grover Norquist, most of the American conservative movement has basically come to believe that any economic penalty on pollution is a tax.  And they are pathologically allergic to taxes.

The idea of simply pricing pollution is so dead, that even Democrats won't consider it.  This means there's only one possible path forward: spending.  But we've just seen that most conservatives are allergic to that too.  And this with conservatives in both parties.  This is also why the Republican climate caucus has zero suggestions beyond spending a little bit on adaptation.  They are hamstrung on policy by an ideological prison of their own construction."
,"Well I’m not telling random deniers they should care, I’m telling *you* that *you* should care 

It just irked me in the original comment of yours that I replied to when you said 

>you owe it to your cause to be good at messaging 

Hopefully you realise climate change is a serious issue, and I would like to think the fact you created this post is proof of that 

In which case, caring about the planet and climate change is now also part of whatever collection of issues you care about"
,"Totally! You are right— bluntly telling people that don’t believe an issue exists in the first place that they need to care will not magically make them care about said issue.
But! You were also right when you said that it’s important to make connections with these deniers, connect the issue to things that they care about so they invest interest in it as well.

Since you are connected to this community in many ways, it sounds like you are perfectly suited to help them see how climate change is negatively impacting them. You seem articulate, motivated, intuitive about human nature, and concerned. I think that means you’re highly qualified to start having climate crisis conversations with your community.
The best part is, you don’t have to have all the answers. In fact, acting like or assuming you do would erode the trust of your audience eventually. So why not start small, make connections in everyday conversation, get a dialogue going with your community."

It was a big deal and after a lot of pressure the world banned CFCs and the problem corrected itself. I think climate change is going to be trickier to fix than CFCs but we are capable of fixing big environmental problems. I really think we'll solve climate change.

Public opinion is going in the right way and green industries and technologies are going to help too.

Keep on telling people about climate change, learn about rhetoric and persuasion and keep on learning the science. The more prepared people we have on the side of truth and science, the better."
,"I’ll simply say this: AR6 draws some considerable focus to the worst-case scenario which, by almost all measurable metrics, is nearly an impossibility. We’re headed for a different world, and one that renders certain areas likely inhospitable. But we’re not headed for cataclysm, even in your lifetime, despite what the news outlets are selling.

Also, the completely ridiculous headlines lately about things ‘warming up faster than expected’ is literal complete fucking hogwash and we are actually warming up at the *exact projected speed* we always were. The IPCC also admits to believing we are in a medium-high pathway currently, which likely renders us between +2.6-3.2c by 2100. This isn’t good, but it’s far from a death sentence. Read the science, not the headlines.

Also, there is some thoughtful reflection of IPCC scenarios that is worth exploring in-depth here. Note that Pielke has a bit of controversy behind him (mostly because of his opinions on some policy implementation issues) but Justin Ritchie is clean. Lots to think about here.

Truthfully I think the next thing is the best thing for any layperson to read about AR6. It covers almost everything you need to know simply, relatively succinctly and without having to drive yourself bonkers over the hard science.

Hang in there, act locally and vote globally. It’s okay to relinquish control over some of this stuff, it’s a little beyond our individual grasps. Focus on surrounding yourself with positive people and situations, and embracing what you have while it’s here. That’s all we can ever do in life, climate change or not."
,"Be the change you want to see, that helped me some."
,"First of all props to you OP for having the courage to ask here and also for educating yourself. You’re generation and those that follow you will definitely be growing up in a world much less stable than you deserve. I think one thing that you, and anyone you can convince to join you, should do is organize. Contact your local,  state, and congressional representatives. They need to know that this is problem #1-5 on your personal watch list and that you and your brethren all plan to vote accordingly. That you expect more and whatever action being undertaken now is not good enough. Shaming people doesn’t always work but in this scenario I’ll be damned if these offices will take being shamed by thousands of young people all in agreement that it’s their futures on the line and how the failures of our representatives have literally put your lives and futures in serious jeopardy. This needs to happen in every town, city, and state because at every level there are things that can be done. 

We have to approach this from every angle. Locally we need to push for climate adaptation / resilience, and in doing our parts to help with mitigation where we can like increasing green spaces, (re)planting of forests and connecting habitats to reduce fragmentation. 

State level actions include all the above local pursuits plus a number of actions that require greater financial power. Increasing scholarship funding for the sciences aimed at tackling issues, like ecology, earth systems, engineering, materials sciences, marine sciences. Pushing for state policies to incentivize green business development. 

For federal representation like congressional and even government organizations we need to advocate for all the above from both state and local categories. As well as demanding some of the simplest things that we should have done decades ago, ie carbon tax. As an aside to just pushing for climate policies I think WE ALL must, absolutely must, all be in agreement that money is in fact not speech and we need to remove as much money out of politics that we can if we stand to make any positive changes to this and many other pressing issues of the day. 

I hope any of these ideas help. Even if all you do is get yourself and a couple of friends to go through the trouble of just calling some of those offices and letting them know that you are watching, learning, and will become a voter soon, this puts just that bit more pressure on them. If you can get something organized so that your school (and others in your area) to all put out a message (find ways to get press coverage too) you’ll have done a lot to put more pressure on the powers that be. Also doing any of those and documenting them would look great in a college application because it shows your commitment and resolve. College is still worth pursuing don’t let this sense of impending doom stop you from living your life and planning for the future. Never ever give up!"

Not sure if it will do you any good but there are two things that help me deal with the anxiety. The first is do what ever is in your capacity and you do that already with a post like this. (For example, I need to choose between an electric car or a bigger hybrid and you helpt me to choose the electric one). At some point I realized that I had to accept that I could not worry about all the things that where beyond my capacity. 
The second thing is to live in the moment. This helps a lot for happiness in general. It means actually focusing on what you are doing and experiencing right now and not be in your head thinking about all the things that are wrong in the world, because there are plenty and pondering about them won't do you any good. Good luck and stay strong."
,"It's important to not think about ACC the way that Hollywood portrays it, as a sudden calamitous event (or series of events) that turns Earth into a death world. Unless humans do something incredibly stupid like nuclear war, it is highly unlikely that you or your children will fade away in a wasteland. What ACC means for most people is that the societal buffers that we have to protect from human and natural disasters will erode with time. Like how there have always been devastating wildfires, but now greater numbers of people are being affected because a combination of ACC and people moving into fire-prone areas. It's the same ideas with hurricanes, famines, and other extreme natural events. Even without ACC, you would live in a world in which they would need to be prepared for such events. But with ACC, these events become significantly more likely.

This extends to human disasters as well. This includes war, of course, if humanity collectively loses its mind in response to mounting pressure from ACC. But it also includes non-lethal disasters such as failure of political democratic leadership and spread of authoritarianism, like we are witnessing now. When people are hurt and afraid, they tend to give their nations over to the biggest jerk in the room. When the consequences of ACC become serious enough that even the most corrupt politician can no longer deny it, there is a danger that people will vote for the person they think is most capable of solving it, even if he/she has to break a few eggs and/or constitutional amendments in the process.

My point in this is that what ACC actually means for most people (low-lying coastal areas aside) is not so much a new novel threat to humanity, but rather dealing with more serious versions of age-old problems with less breathing room for error. We will have to face our problems and the consequences rather than run, because we can't run from a global problem (either literally or figuratively). But ACC will not hit like an asteroid strike. You are very likely not condemned to a bleak hellscape - there will be times of joy and laughter just as there are today. There will still be beauty and wonder in the world, even if you have to travel further to see it. But when problems occur, whether natural or human in origin, they will hit harder and more often than they do now. Sometimes much more so. And you will have to be prepared for that. (1/2)"

Being in the same generation as you i have to say i am also scared, mad, sad, and over all frustrated at the inertia of major goverments and corporations on the fight against climate change, i KNOW (not based on any study, simply logic) that IF we dont do what is needed right this second, our generation is going to live in a broken world, survivable, but not livable as it is now. 

I live in Brazil, a 3rd world country ""run"" by Jair Messias Bolsonaro, an incompetent, ignorant, irresponsible dumbass, and as you probably know Brazil is home to one of the biggest tropical rainforests in the world. As you can also probably guess, the health and wellbeing of this forest is greatly influenced by climate change, and vice versa, but as of right now, the president of my country does *fuck all* to stop woodsman form chopping down hundreds of thousands of trees everyday, and not using the soil for planting, but instead for the maintaining of livestock.

This, is a huge problem, and i have cried because of the harm that is done to the planet everyday. However, we shouldnt give up home just yet, for if the situation is dire we will need to take drastic measures, and i believe that we can stop the ghost of greed that walks through our streets and burns our nature, and make the world a some-what better place in the future.

,"It is important to remember that nature may be apathetic to humanity's plight, but it isn't cruel or judgmental. It isn't going to condemn all the generations of mankind to follow for our ""sins"". So there will likely never be a point where humanity has pushed nature so far that it simply decides to shake humanity off its back like fleas on a dog. The consequences of ACC accumulate as we continue to destabilize the climate, but that also means that there is probably no singular point of ""abandon all hope"" where there is no longer any use in trying to solve the problem. Passing the 2 degC limit set by the Paris agreement will sting, but not as much as passing 3 degC warming, and not nearly as much as passing 4 degC, etc. There is always a best that we can do.

Now, it is possible that if humanity *really* shoves the climate system, by say burning all our coal reserves, we might trigger one of the planet's ""tipping point"" landmines and render much of Earth inhospitable for unprotected humans - the aforementioned hellscape where you'd have to wear a spacesuit to visit Florida. But I don't think we are going to act *that* stupidly - triggering a planetary climate shift can't be done suddenly and ""accidentally"" the same way as a nuclear war. Humanity will likely find *some* way to avoid the worst possible consequences of ACC, even if it pays dearly in the process. The questions are how will we do it, how much needless suffering will we experience, and what price do we pay? Do we address ACC with the sociopolitical tools we currently have, come out of it with some damage, but with our liberal democratic institutions more-or-less intact? Or do we wait longer, suffer more damage, put authoritarian jerks in control, and experience a second ""Dark Age"" with our democratic institutions destroyed? I wish I knew the answer to that, but of course I don't.

So I know these aren't great words of hope, but maybe putting some perspective on the situation will help? ACC is a serious problem indeed, and I don't mean to downplay it, but try not to buy into the media hysteria machine either. ACC is a complex problem with complex consequences, and it isn't as simple as ""stop burning all fossil fuels next year or your kids will be digging up landfills for food"". You will likely have significantly more difficult and frequent problems to face as a result of ACC, but they will still have the opportunity to live meaningful and fulfilling lives just like us, despite the challenges we face.

He basically came right out and said (in non-exact words) that he wrote *The Uninhabitable Earth* as a knee-jerk reaction to surrounding himself in the media doom and gloom. Since, he’s actually learned the science better and admits to having a more optimistic outlook on the future because of it… at least more optimistic than before. 

While DWW approaches things still more from the macabre standpoint, he brought a child into the world. So… this guy is either a complete prick to bring someone into a dying world, or maybe just maybe did he educate himself about the likely future and its challenges, but not on the improbable ultimate collapse of society strictly because of climate change.

,"I don’t think I mentioned tipping points? They’re certainly nothing to scoff at, and things we want to avoid if we can. But, in all fairness, the phrase *tipping point* is a relatively serious matter that has been fetishized by irresponsible reporting and people with a weak understanding of what they mean. These are multi-decade events at the minimum, mostly far beyond that scope. Centuries, millennia. Some can be curbed and reduced in a timely manner, others not so much. It’s somehow become a very trendy phrase due to its latent connotations, and less so because of its real-world fallout.

I’d really, really, REALLY suggest the third link in my OP as there are two very in-depth breakdowns of tipping points, what they mean, and their likelihood. They rate each potential tipping point based on trajectory and timescale for reversibility. The up-front-and-dirty is that we need to limit ALL of these to our best ability… for future generations’ sake. The collapse sub thinks that the BOE, for instance, is essentially their version of the rapture. In realistic terms… not so much. Not even close. 

Most tipping points are complex and I’ll let the experts speak for themselves, but for instance iirc the theorized additional heating if ALL methane were to be released by 2100 would come out to a staggering and world-altering… +0.17c of warming?

2.6-3.2C would be SSP 2-4.5. Everything I read says we are between SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. That puts us somewhere between 4-5C. It may have been too strong to say we are not even close to those goals but I don’t see it at the SSP 2-4.5 projection. This is what I’m talking about.

I don’t think you can compare the smart phone to removing 43 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year. And that’s assuming it doesn’t increase which is not realistic.

Yes there are technologies that are being worked on but they are no where close to being economically feasible on the scale needed. And even economically feasible means spending trillions of dollars each year. We can’t get governments to even spend money on reducing CO2 emissions much less spending money on removing it.

>instead of relying some guy on Reddit to spoon-feed you.

How does that help the debate? I also do some research that doesn’t agree with you.

>If none of my predictions come to fruition? Ok, then we’re at +2.6-3.2c and it keeps on rising, and every passing decade beyond 2100 becomes more and more unstable and uninhabitable.

Something like that is my fear. I certainly don't see it going down anytime in the future at this point.

>I’m just a dude on Reddit. I don’t really know what you’re finishing for considering I do not pretend to be anywhere near an expert on the science nor that policy, just someone moderately informed.

I am the same as you. I certainly don’t claim to be an expert. But my concern is that all the talk about different pathways doesn’t match the CO2 PPM path which is still increasing exponentially and so far shows no sign of slowing down.

All of the scenarios are based on the amount of CO2 emitted by humans. All except the 8.5 assume reduced coal usage. None of them account for other forms of CO2 inserted into the atmosphere like wildfires which are becoming a problem or release of CO2 from permafrost. I think that you think permafrost is just a minor problem but some scientists think it could be major. And there are other tipping points that it’s possible we may or may not have already passed. So when I see the CO2 PPM value start to STOP increasing exponentially I will feel a lot better about global warming.

[Here](https://theconversation.com/hothouse-earth-heres-what-the-science-actually-does-and-doesnt-say-101341) is an article by a scientist that is just considering how things could turn really bad. Please don’t accuse me of trying to say this is going to happen, I’m just saying according to some scientist this can not be ruled out at this point."
,"I’ve been thinking about how to explain my doubts about any eco-tech breakthroughs and it occurred to me that it’s not the breakthroughs that is the problem. We’ve already had many breakthroughs and there are now some large mechanical units that are removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However compared to how much we are adding to the atmosphere it’s minute. But the real problem is the energy that would be required to remove the CO2. When you think about how much energy was used to put that CO2 in the atmosphere by refineries and power plants, you can see it will take about the same amount to take it out. That is a huge amount of energy that must be paid for somehow. And how are we going to create the energy. Will it be by using fossil fuels or what? So just adding my thoughts on that."

The article posted is one I’m definitely familiar with… I thought it was actually a good, sober approach to the article in question. Here are some of my key take-aways for why I think it actually trends more positive and cautious than a tip toward more aggressive heating this century:

> They also acknowledge large uncertainty in this estimate, and say that it represents a “risk averse approach”.
*A key point is that, even if the self-perpetuating changes do begin within a few decades, the process would take a long time to fully kick in – centuries or millennia.*

> With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay presents the scenario as definite and imminent. The impression is given that 2°C is a definite “point of no return”, and that beyond that the “hothouse” scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the caveats that the 2°C threshold is extremely uncertain, and that even if it were correct, the extreme conditions would not occur for centuries or millennia.

So again, tipping points are not something I dismiss but there is still a ton of uncertainty, with most certainty coming in that they will likely be ‘activated’ this century but both does not support an abrupt change (in human terms) nor do some of these theories hold a ton of water when viewed in a technical sense of their interactions with the large-scale changes happening.

I’m truthfully just not sure where you’re seeing or reading anything about that level of warming… period. That was a line of thinking that generally got tossed out in 2013, let alone today. I can pull up a ton of things pretty easily showing that our current pathways are heading towards my prediction. I don’t know, I’m not looking for information to blindly support this notion, so much as finding it to be the prevalent theory in overall climate literature. 

Here’s a thread by Glen Peters himself (author of what you posted) substantiating some of my predictions. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/peters_glen/status/1222808991635513348

> In summary, I would say current emissions are tracking mid- to high-end scenarios. But, does that mean therefore we end up at 4-5°C? No. RCP85 emissions require huge coal use. It is possible to track RCP85 now, but deviate substantially in 2040.

^This is critically important to understanding my theory - RCP8.5 tracks similarly to nearly all realistic pathways for us (i.e. NOT the lowest ones), for the next few *decades,* this is something that I think gets lost on a lot of people - not necessarily saying you, but in case you didn’t know.

This article does a pretty good job corroborating this, and is written by the AR6 principle author.

https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/3c-world

> Our business-as-usual projection of 3C of warming — rather than 4 or 5C — is a testament to the progress in global decarbonization over the last few decades. It also reflects the fact that rapid growth in coal use during the 2000s was not necessarily characteristic of longer-term energy use trends. The world has taken concrete steps to move away from coal in the past decade, and this progress should be reflected in our assessment of likely emissions pathways — and their resulting climate impacts — going forward.

Just because we’re not seeing the scale of movement that we want, the overall scales are shifting and to a rather fair degree, and moderately quickly considering a complete decarbonization would quite literally sink most world economies and cause far more problems than climate change will in the next few decades. And to that,

> IEA scenarios still project future growth in fossil fuel use through 2040, just slower than most IPCC baseline scenarios, particularly for coal. For example, IEA’s CPS predicts that coal consumption will grow by around 0.5% per year through 2040, compared to growth rates between 1% and 3% for most AR5 and SSP baseline scenarios. Average annual growth in coal combustion across AR5 and SSP baseline scenarios is 1.5%. 

> Even a current policies scenario where emissions continued to steadily grow rather than leveling off after 2040 would still end up well-below the commonly used RCP8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario, which represents the highest end of the range of no-policy baseline scenarios examined in the literature. It would also have CO2 emissions around 20% lower than SSP3-7.0. Even if emissions do not peak after 2040, the lower emissions values in 2040 means that the total emissions over the century remain substantially lower.

> Warming in the the two IEA scenarios is calculated based on the difference between cumulative fossil fuel and industry emissions in each scenario and that in the SSP2-4.5 scenario. These cumulative emissions differences are converted into additional warming based on the IPCC SR15 TCRE value of 1.65C per 1000 PgC, with a range from 0.8C to 2.5C / 1000 PgC reflecting uncertainties in climate sensitivity. Finally, this additional warming is added to RCP4.5 warming projections, with the average, low, and high TCRE-based additional warming values added to the average, low, and high RCP4.5 warming values, respectively.

> In this analysis the two IEA scenarios imply end-of-century warming of a bit below 3C (2.9C for current policies, 2.7C for stated policies). They are a bit higher than the 2.6C mean outcome in RCP4.5, and lower than the 3C mean of RCP6.0. They produce nowhere near as much warming as the 4.5C mean estimate of RCP8.5, the scenario often described as a “business as usual” scenario. However, the uncertainties in climate sensitivity mean that current policies may result in as much as 3.8C warming — or as little as 2C warming.

Truthfully I think I have more resources that I could dig up that tend tend to support my assertions. I’m certainly always up for learning and seeing more but idk, I just haven’t really seen anything that backs your numbers up other than very fringe science by questionable figureheads and without substantial peer-review. I know there’s a lot of copy+pasta above but I’ll never be able to articulate some of things as meaningfully and coherently as the actual smarties studying this stuff.

I’ll fully admit my understanding of the technological side is a little lacking compared to the science, but I truthfully believe in my hear it’s a little naive and defeatist to think there won’t be substantial mitigation techniques we can find, alongside decarbonization, in the later half of the century. That’s an emotional idea, and one that I guess I just put faith into. I think humans have figured out some pretty crazy shit in the past, and our resources, technology, and head count just keeps increasing, it’s hard for me to imagine not finding some things that will really help us."
,"I completely agree on this! I sort of responded with a jumble of thoughts to your other post and admitted, this side is not something I’m as knowledgeable on and freely admit that. I’ve kept up with some promising technologies but know that there are some substantial barriers to mass-implementations. I don’t want any of my other merits to necessarily be tarnished because of my Pollyanna ‘deus-ex machina’ eco tech dream solution. I was just sort of throwing out my wild speculation as far as that’s concerned - being fully transparent."
,"I’m just going to touch on a few points in your reply.

Glen Peters is not the author of what I posted but he is a respected climate scientists. If you look at the total CO2 emissions chart he posted it shows 2019 is closer to RCP8.5 than to any other RCP. The 2020 year CO2 emissions decreased, apparently due to COVID but 2021 has jumped and already passed 2019. And Glen states:

**I would say ""current emissions track the mid- to high-end of a range of long-term scenarios”.**

Your second link from Breakthrough looks to me like it was written by Zeke Hausfather and Justin Ritchie. I could not find where either was an AR6 principal author but maybe I just missed it. The first link in that article to the IEA did not work and the second to the UN program did not seem to say what they said it does. In fact this is in their executive summary:

**“There is no sign of GHG emissions peaking in the next few years; every year of postponed peaking means that deeper and faster cuts will be required. By 2030, emissions would need to be 25 per cent and 55 per cent lower than in 2018 to put the world on the least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to below 2˚C and 1.5°C respectively”**

In addition I think it is well known that the IEA is known to have ties to the fossil fuel industry and consistently underestimate renewable energy. Wikipedia gives a list of criticisms of the organization.

I have run across Justin Ritchie before and know he downplays the threat of global warming. However the organization he works for (Breakthrough) issued a report in 2018 titled “Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach” which states the following:

**With the commitments by nations to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the current path of warming is 3°C or more  by 2100. But this figure does not include “long-term” carbon-cycle feedbacks, which are literally relevant now and in the near future due to the unprecedented rate at which human activity is perturbing the climate system. Taking these into account, the Paris path would lead to around 5°C of warming by 2100.**

You might want to take a look as it seems not everyone at Breakthrough shares his more relaxed attitude towards climate change.

The rest of your reply seems to just be twitter opinion comments so I’m going to stop commenting and ask you some questions.

From what I’ve read the IPCC reports are conservative. I’ll define conservative as those that don’t think climate change is that bad and progressives that think it is very bad. What I’ve read is that the report cannot be issued until every participant has agreed and the conservatives will fight to reduce the amount of alarm in the report whereas the progressives are so concerned about the climate that they will agree to less alarm to just get the report out and then try to comment in the press about how it is worse than being reported. With that as background, why is it that every ICPP report has been more and more confident that climate change is a danger to mankind and every report plays catchup by reporting it is worse than thought in the last report? Just like the AR6 is saying.

Why does the CO2 PPM continue to go up at an exponential rate even when emissions are lower like in 2020? Could it be we have already passed some tipping points and other factors are now adding CO2 or the oceans are getting saturated and cannot absorb as much CO2?

Do you see any evidence that countries will reduce their CO2 emissions enough to meet the goals necessary to start reducing CO2 PPM increases? I’m not talking about commitments, I’m talking about actual reductions.

If CO2 PPM in the atmosphere continues to increase is there some time in the future when you will admit it is really bad and too late to change without drastic economic measures?

My point being I think it's time we started taking some pretty drastic measures in order to make that happen now. That's not to say we have to destroy or even damage the economy but to make changes in government that require rapid movements from fossil fuels to non-polluting fuels. After all how much benefit would it be to business to have free energy sources instead of paying for fossil fuels and then paying to remove the by-products of fossil fuels. And how many lives would be extended by reducing pollution caused by fossil fuels. And even more exasperating to me, what gives companies the right to take the public's air, use it to produce products for profit, and then dump it back out into the atmosphere polluted. And I'm not even talking about CO2 but it also is a problem. How would you feel about a company next door to you that said they wanted to use your living room as a toilet so they could make more money by not building their own toilet? You really can't get around the fact that they are basically using the public's atmosphere as a toilet and making money by not cleaning their own mess up."

,"The greening of planet Earth absorbs CO2 !!


Amid all the talk of an imminent planetary catastrophe caused by emissions of carbon dioxide, another fact is often ignored: global greening is happening faster than climate change. The amount of vegetation growing on the earth has been increasing every year for at least 30 years. The evidence comes from the growth rate of plants and from satellite data.
In 2016 a paper was published by 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries that analysed satellite data and concluded that there had been a roughly 14% increase in green vegetation over 30 years. The study attributed 70% of this increase to the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The lead author on the study, Zaichun Zhu of Beijing University, says this is equivalent to adding a new continent of green vegetation twice the size of the mainland United States.
Global greening has affected all ecosystems – from arctic tundra to coral reefs to plankton to tropical rain forests – but shows up most strongly in arid places like the Sahel region of Africa, where desertification has largely now reversed. This is because plants lose less water in the process of absorbing carbon dioxide if the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher. Ecosystems and farms will be less water-stressed at the end of this century than they are today during periods of low rainfall.
There should have been no surprise about this news. Thousands of experiments have been conducted over many years in which levels of CO2 had been increased over crops or wild ecosystems and boosted their growth. The owners of commercial greenhouses usually pump CO2 into the air to speed up the growth of plants. CO2 is plant food.
This greening is good news. It means more food for insects and deer, for elephants and mice, for fish and whales. It means higher yields for farmers; indeed, the effect has probably added about $3 trillion to farm incomes over the last 30 years. So less land is needed to feed the human population and more can be spared for wildlife instead.
Yet this never gets mentioned. In their desperation to keep the fearmongering on track the activists who make a living off the climate change scare do their best to ignore this inconvenient truth. When they cannot avoid the subject, they say that greening is a temporary phenomenon that will reverse in the latter part of this century. The evidence for this claim comes from a few models fed with extreme assumptions, so it cannot be trusted.
This biological phenomenon can also help to explain the coming and going of ice ages. It has always been a puzzle that ice ages grow gradually colder for tens of thousands of years, then suddenly warmer again in the space of a few thousand years, at which point the huge ice caps of Eurasia and North America collapse and the world enters a warmer interlude, such as the one we have been enjoying for 10,000 years.
Attempts to explain this cyclical pattern have mostly failed so far. Carbon dioxide levels track the change, but these rise after the world starts to warm and fall after the world starts to cool, so they are not the cause. Changes in the shape of the earth’s orbit play a role, with ice sheets collapsing when the northern summers are especially warm, but only some of these so-called “great summers” result in deglaciation.
Recent ice cores from the Antarctic appear to have fingered the culprit at last: it’s all about plants. During ice ages, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere steadily drops, because colder oceans absorb more of the gas. Eventually it reaches such a low level – about 0.018% at the peak of the last ice age – that plants struggle to grow at all, especially in dry areas or at high altitudes. As a result gigantic dust storms blanket the entire planet, reaching even Antarctica, where the amount of dust in the ice spikes dramatically upward. These dust storms blacken the northern ice sheets in particular, making them highly vulnerable to rapid melting when the next great summer arrives. The ice age was a horrible time to be alive even in the tropics: cold, dry, dusty and far less plant life than today.
As Svante Arrhenius, the Swede who first measured the greenhouse effect, said: “By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates.” Enjoy the lush greenery of the current world and enjoy the fact that green vegetation is changing faster than global average temperatures."

,"Yes, there are two ways they can help long term.

The first is just permanently increasing the amount of forested land below a certain latitude ( if they stop snow, they lower albedo and warm the Earth ... https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tropical-forests-cool-earth/ ).  Right now 3 trillion trees store 400 gigatons of carbon.  Another trillion trees could store another 133 gigatons.  We emit 37 gigatons per year, so an extra trillion trees stores 3.5 years worth of emissions.

The second way is using trees (and actually any photosynthetic organism) to use sunlight to turn CO2 into something less gaseous (wood or other plant matter, calcium carbonite, etc) and then processing the result to stabilize the carbon for at least millennia ( e.g., using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis ).  Trees are pretty slow growing, so to actually offset the 37 gigatons of emissions, you'd probably need to do something like this http://carbon.ycombinator.com/ocean-phytoplankton/ .  But having more trees would be nice as well."

Here's my favorite thought experiment around this issue: 

Q: If trees are capable of permanently sequestering carbon at such high rates through natural processes, then why didn't the trees of the world suck all of the CO2 out of the atmosphere during the millions of years prior to the industrial revolution? 

A: The carbon cycle.

Trees don't permanently sequester the carbon they capture. It's reintroduced to the atmosphere through decomposition. For this idea to work we'd have to bury every single tree we plant so deep in the Earth that bacteria can't get to it and decomposition can't occur, which simply isn't possible."

This is a lie. 

&#x200B;

>Here we document a regional-scale shift in stock–recruitment relationships of corals along the Great Barrier Reef—the world’s largest coral reef system—following unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching events caused by global warming. As a consequence of mass mortality of adult brood stock in 2016 and 2017 owing to heat stress[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1081-y#ref-CR6), the amount of larval recruitment declined in 2018 by 89% compared to historical levels. For the first time, brooding pocilloporids replaced spawning acroporids as the dominant taxon in the depleted recruitment pool. The collapse in stock–recruitment relationships indicates that the low resistance of adult brood stocks to repeated episodes of coral bleaching is inexorably tied to an impaired capacity for recovery, which highlights the multifaceted processes that underlie the global decline of coral reefs. The extent to which the Great Barrier Reef will be able to recover from the collapse in stock–recruitment relationships remains uncertain, given the projected increased frequency of extreme climate events over the next two decades[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1081-y#ref-CR7).

I‘m not a CO2 denier, I‘m more of the opposite and think that the protection of the climate should be the top priority of every country, but I want to compare solutions and know which one is effective in which way, and what possibilities there are to store CO2 in the ground for long periods of time, like millions of years, so de facto permanently."
,"Thank you very much, I definitely learned some interesting pieces from your comment. From how I could tell, the best thing we can do with trees in latitudes like Northern Europe, is to process the wood and use it as a storage.

When thinking about it, it‘s pretty logical and trivial as I already knew it from Minecraft.

Today, I also learned about the thing with calcium carbonite, as well as Limestone.

What I only heard once but will definitely read into, because of your last article, is using plankton (did not know that it is specifically phytoplankton) to extract CO2 from the atmosphere. There was a listening comprehension in my A-Level exams that was about ways of preventing climate change, and that was the method which caught my eye (besides rather silly things like sending a huge mirror into the atmosphere).

Anyways, thank you for further expanding my knowledge about this interesting and very important topic."
,"**Pyrolysis**

Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It involves a change of chemical composition and is irreversible. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro ""fire"" and lysis ""separating"".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials.

I wouldn't look at this as a be-all end-all and more of a potential repair solution. The REAL solution would indeed be ending fossil fuel subsidies and forcing a transfer to clean energy economy. That still leaves us with a shitty planet though. This is a way to fix that. And on the subject of burying the dead trees, what if we used pyrolysis to turn the dead ones into charcoal and used that to enrich the soil? I'm not saying it's a PERFECT solution, but I'd love to know more about feasibility...

implies unprecedented: Tipping points are not one off events. Given long enough they can repeat, one of the ways we know those issues exist is archaeological evidence of the last time they happened. e.g. Last time the seabed methane  deposits sublimated was a few 100 million years ago. Would for sure be a tipping point if that happens a 2nd time. Not that anyone would survive to record it."
,That's still not what a tipping point is. A tipping point is simply a point in which a small initial change results in a large change in the final state. Or another way to put it is that it's a point where a system is no longer in stable equilibrium and will shift to a new equilibrium.
,"I'm aware of chaos theory :)

On Venus (to own knowledge) there has never been life, so tipping points just change the climate. The right tipping point might even make it habitable to some form of life.

On Earth there's (currently) life. Any tipping point will leaved the wrong plants in the wrong climate.  So they are all bad for for current species. Regardless of what exact tipping point occurs."

,"I see that you edited your post, so I'll edit mine. Again that's not what a tipping point means.

""Irreversible change"" isn't a tipping point. Tipping points may lead to irreversible change, but that's not what makes it a tipping point. For example, one such tipping point is stratospheric clouds. There is a point where a minor change in temperature leads to a dramatic change in the frequency of stratospheric clouds. That's not an extinction causing tipping point."

So China is taking immediate action. It's slow, but still, action that is happening right now. They're backing off of coal usage, implementing green energy and such programs, and use mass transit.

,"I would argue the exact opposite. China, as a whole,  is not yet as industrialized as the western world, which is the real reason for the lower emissions per capita. If their living standards (overall, not just the major cities) increase to western levels it would be a catastrophe for the environment. At the same time they are producing a lot of energy inefficiently for example by burning coal, which means there would be more gains through efficiency in their developing economy than in a western economy where those efficiency gains have already been realized decades ago.

Just to make sure, I am not blaming anything on China. Each nation has to address climate change in their own frame of reference."

I disagree. Every positive bit of difference, no matter how small, always means less CO2 enters the atmosphere which is an inherently good thing. Admittedly, we do need large scale changes to our different infrastructure systems in order to meet targets but never downplay the effect that millions of people pursuing positive action can have in moving the world towards a brighter future.

>Do what you can for sure, but manage expectations, and feel lucky for what we enjoy at the moment.

Absolutely agree. Last year I was pretty pessimistic about where we were heading but this year seeing how fast climate change awareness has risen and the fact that elections are being won on the issue, I've become more optimistic about where we can go from here. However, there are fine lines between optimism, pessimism and delusion. I try my best to stay within what I feel is most effective for solving this problem."

,"Sadly, that's not up to us, and impossible (or very expensive) in the current situation. But I agree that publically funded research \*should\* be public. It requires that well-established universities come together and make not-for-profit open-access journals."
,"It sounds to me like you're leaning towards skepticism not due to any evaluation of the data, models, mechanisms, or other evidence--but are simply annoyed with the culture and therefore pushing back.  Am I describing your state of mind correctly?

Look, the problem is that the scientific literature is not going to be accessible to you because the publishing industry is exploiting scientists' work and making out like bandits.  It's not the *scientists* who get the money you pay when you buy a paywalled article.  I can tell you that from experience.  It's the same in my discipline of biomedical sciences as it is in the earth sciences.

By looking for debates, I also fear you're setting yourself up for failure.  Science is only a debate insofar as the evidence is inconclusive.  There is no debate, for example, on germ theory or on genetic inheritance.  Carbon dioxide-induced global warming exists in that same realm of certainty: it would take an extraordinary discovery that completely upends our past 50 years of science to change it!"
,"Firstly, the idea that those who deny the mountain of evidence that global warming is real and it's due to human activity are actual skeptics is kinda funny. Scientists are skeptics. People who cite random blog posts from people who've taken money from the fossil fuel industry to promote the idea that there's a ""debate"" in the scientific world about the reality of global warming are not skeptics. For them, denial of the science has become their religion. They post YouTube videos and link to blog posts that ""prove global warming isn't real"" without offering any scientific evidence for the same. Or they link to a paper that's been proven to be invalid due to its methodology or its conclusions don't follow the evidence presented. I can post a link to a blog that assures me that, due to astrological conditions, the weather three years from now will be fine. I can cite a book that will tell you in no uncertain terms that vaccinations cause autism. Neither contain evidence that hasn't already been thoroughly debunked. 

Because science isn't done on YouTube or blog posts. Science is done through peer reviewed articles published in reputable journals. As mentioned elsewhere, that doesn't necessarily mean those articles are fully accessible. That said, there are plenty of resources available for free if you care to look.

It's unfortunate that you were met with personal attacks. Equally unfortunate is that the deniers engage in similar tactics.

The problem is that what you're looking for is a little hard to find. You're looking for evidence that both sides could be right. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as that. I am sure there are scientists looking for some way to prove that the CO2 and methane we're dumping into the atmosphere is NOT having an effect on the climate. That it's something else. Or that the climate isn't as sensitive to a doubling in CO2 as what multiple studies seem to indicate. 

Unfortunately, at the moment, it seems to be the case that a) the man-made CO2 and CH4 are the main drivers of the current warming trend and b) that a doubling of CO2 will result in a warming of roughly 3 degrees centigrade.

It'd be nice if this weren't the case but the evidence doesn't seem to point that way."

,"Your selective quoting is fun, but a gish-gallop is not evidence. But hey, you've provided, so lets go.

Sure, if someone were to look at your quotes in isolation they might come to the conclusion that the IPCC don't know what the hell they're talking about. But that's not the case, is it?

Anyway, you wrote:

>For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. 

But here's the full quote ([https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR\_AR5\_FINAL\_full\_wcover.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf) p48):

>Over every continental region except Antarctica, anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century (Figure 1.10). For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. In contrast, it is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial Arctic warming since the mid-20th century. Human influence has likely contributed to temperature increases in many sub-continental regions. {WGI SPM D.3, TS.4.8, 10.3.1} 

That's a bit different isn't it? So for every continental region, the report is more than 66% (because that's what ""likely"" means in the context of the report) sure that the temperature increases are due to human activity. 

You seem quite hung up about the uncertainties involved with Antarctica. That's okay, nothing against that, but it's not the whole report.

You also wrote:

>There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale

But following that (and thus providing more nuance) was:

>The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by a lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments, making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult. However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding on a regional scale (medium confidence). Costs related to flood damage, worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets. {WGI 2.6.2, WGII 3.2.7, SREX SPM B}

And again for long term changes in tropical cyclone activity. The full quote:

>There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic since 1970. {WGI Table SPM.1, 2.6.3, 10.6}

Did you forget to leave that part out? Or did you just not like it because it doesn't fit with the vision of yourself as an educator of ""alarmists""?

You quote an excerpt about rising sea levels:

>it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century

But leave out the fact that this is about risk management. The full quote:

>For example, it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century, but the consequence of a greater rise could be so severe that this possibility becomes a significant part of risk assessment. Similarly, low confidence but high consequence outcomes are also policy relevant; for instance the possibility that the response of Amazon forest could substantially amplify climate change merits consideration despite our currently imperfect ability to project the outcome. (2.4, Table 2.3) {WGI Table 13.5, WGII SPM A-3, 4.4, Box 4-3, WGIII Box 3-9, SYR Glossary

And again, in relation to droughts, there's low confidence due to direct observations. But the quote is more extensive than that:

>There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations, dependencies of inferred trends on the choice of the definition for drought, and due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There is also low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th century, due to the same observational uncertainties and difficulties in distinguishing decadal scale variability in drought from long-term trends. {WGI Table SPM.1, [2.6.2.3](https://2.6.2.3), 10.6, Figure 2.33, WGII [3.ES](https://3.ES), 3.2.7}

When the IPCC says ""low confidence"" they're not saying it doesn't happen. They're saying that the evidence is limited and there's no agreement on what that limited data is telling us. Or that there may be some agreement, but still a lack of evidence. (See: [https://wg1.ipcc.ch/AR6/documents/AR5\_Uncertainty\_Guidance\_Note.pdf](https://wg1.ipcc.ch/AR6/documents/AR5_Uncertainty_Guidance_Note.pdf))

You said: 

>So the IPCC itself says that there are no more flooding, hurricanes, droughts due to our Co2 emissions. They acknowledge that the Antarctic ice is constant or even growing. And the sea level will not rise a meaningful amount even in the next eighty years

But the IPCC did **NOT** say that. They variously said:

* we don't have enough information to say with any degree of certainty that tropical cyclones are increasing, but we're 99% certain that there are more storms in the North Atlantic
* we don't have enough data to be able to say that droughts are increasing but it's due to a number of factors, not the least of which is the definition of drought
* ""Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass (high confidence)"" (p42, sn. 1.1.3 Cryosphere)
* that while sea level rise is unlikely (i.e. between 0 and 33%) the risk posed to people, societies economic sectors and ecosystems is still there

Again you misrepresent what the report says when you state:

>AR5 has a temperature graph SPM1a on page 3, where the temperature seems to have increased about 0.6 degrees C between 1951 and 2010, and basically they do not know how much of that is human caused, but it may be no more than half, so 0.6\*0.5 = 0.3 degrees C. That is a far cry from the 0.9 degrees that the earth has warmed since 1850 according to the instrumental record, the IPCC is only claiming a third of this for ""anthropocentric"" Co2 emissions!

You cite SPM1a, and yet the report clearly states:

>The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 \[0.65 to 1.06\] °C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist (Figure SPM.1a). {1.1.1, Figure 1.1}

The same report you cite explains your ""more than half"" distortion and fantasy math quite clearly:

>It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together (Figure 1.9). **The best estimate of the human induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period**. GHGs contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3°C over the period 1951 to 2010, with further contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, from natural forcings, and from natural internal variability (see Figure 1.9).

Summary: All the warming seen is there because of humans and that's *after taking into account the negative forcing we've introduced through the addition of aerosols*. How'd you miss that?"
,">I have stated my belief.  Make of it what you want.

> The Getz region of West Antarctica is losing ice at an increasing rate; however, the forcing mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use satellite observations and an ice sheet model to measure the change in ice speed and mass balance of the drainage basin over the last 25-years. Our results show a mean increase in speed of 23.8 % between 1994 and 2018, with three glaciers accelerating by over 44 %. Speedup across the Getz basin is linear, with speedup and thinning directly correlated confirming the presence of dynamic imbalance.
>
> Since 1994, **315 Gt of ice has been lost contributing 0.9 ± 0.6 mm global mean sea level**, with increased loss since 2010 caused by a snowfall reduction. Overall, dynamic imbalance accounts for two thirds of the mass loss from this region of West Antarctica over the past 25-years, with a longer-term response to ocean forcing the likely driving mechanism.

EDIT: Annual average ice loss from Greenland has been 250 billion tons over the past decade, which makes sense when you consider that the average sea level rise is something like ~3.4 mm right now and Greenland amounts to around a quarter of it, or slightly less than 1 mm.

> From the 1970s through the early 1990s, the Greenland Ice Sheet was roughly in balance, with mass gains equaling mass losses. In the mid‐1990s, however, Greenland ice loss began and accelerated. By combining ~1985–2015 records of changing outlet glacier flow, ice edge positions, and ice sheet surface elevation, we show that the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet is undergoing a significant reconfiguration. Ice edge retreat is ubiquitous, with virtually no glaciers experiencing advance, while some areas of the ice sheet have sped up and others have slowed.
>
> Our observations reveal a rapid reconfiguration around the full ice sheet margin, with narrowing areas of fast ice flow, changes in the routing of ice flow, and glacier outlets that are likely being abandoned. The implications of rapid ice sheet reconfiguration are wide ranging. Water movement underneath the ice sheet likely changes, along with the quantity and timing of iceberg production and freshwater input to the ocean, affecting the nutrients and sediment transport from the ice sheet to local and regional ecosystems. Without detailed observations of earlier deglaciations and with limits on ice sheet computer simulation capabilities, these observational records provide an important analogue for past deglaciation and for projecting future ice loss.

> But this is only half of the story. **To get the total mass balance, we must also factor in the losses of ice from the breaking off, or “calving”, of icebergs and from ocean melting at its edge. Including these processes gives a total mass loss of 152bn tonnes for the year**.
>
> This means that the Greenland ice sheet has again seen an overall decline in ice mass this year. However, this loss is not as large as last year – which saw a loss of 329bn tonnes – **or the annual average over the past decade of around 250bn per year**."

,Because of it's location leaving it at the mercy of Atlantic influence Greenland ice gain and loss is not steady. According to the [national Snow and Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/greenland-today/) mass was gained up to June. But it's now summer so there's melting.

,"Firstly, you're going to have to show some reputable science that projects either

* a collapse of agriculture
* the extinction of the human race

Otherwise your claims just look like doomer fanfic."
,">It shows a rapid rise initially the from about 6,000 years ago the trend has been flat with consistent variations

Your opinion seems to be based on data that disagrees with current paleoclimate reconstructions.

Kaufman et al. (2020) \[1\] shows that a long term cooling trend has dominated the global temperature record for the last 6000 years or so, with the exception of the last century and a half. See [figure 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7/figures/3) for instance.

Can you provide your source that shows otherwise? I'd be interested to see it.

>After the hot year of 1998 the IPCC adopted Manns hockey stick curve and appended the prediction to the historical data

This is quite a confusing sentence and prompts a number of questions

* Why is a hot year important to a long term trend?
* How exactly does one ""append a prediction"" to a global temperature reconstruction. The hockey stick was not projecting anything and was a multi-measurement reconstruction that included proxies and the instrumental temperature record
* Are you under the impression that there is a large conspiracy involving thousands of scientists that's aimed at convincing us that temperatures are rising when they're actually not? If so, to what end?

As above, I'm really interested in the answers.

>I began following the climate debate around this time and read quite a few publications by authors who disagree with the predictions

Again, many questions

* What predictions are you talking about? Were these predictions presented in scientific papers?
* Which publications did you read? Were they scientific publications? Were they blogs?
* Given that this occurred in the late 90's and early 2000's, has your opinion changed as scientific evidence has mounted? Or are you still reading these ""publications by authors who disagree"" with the large body of evidence?

>These reinforced my skepticism of the dire consequences of CO2

Are you under the impression that CO2 is *not* causing the rapid warming trend we've seen since the Industrial Revolution? If so, can you please explain what's driving the warming?

I'm curious because a number of your posts - and this one - seem to rely heavily on opinion rather than empirical evidence. I hope you understand that opinion - no matter how heartfelt - isn't particularly relevant when it comes to discussing objective facts. In particular:

* The earth is warming
* It's due to human emissions of CO2
* It's happening more rapidly than at any time in the last 11,000 years
* The consequences for large parts of the earth and a significant proportion of the human population are likely to be - to put it mildly - quite bad

I could go on, but this serves to highlight the fact that these conclusions are based on science, whereas yours appears to be solely your opinion. Or possibly the opinion of the bloggers and reporters and authors of articles that you read that aren't basing their opinions on science either. It's hard to tell.

,"Yeah see the problem with this kind of assertion is that it's not worth the effort it requires. The Tories have been in power for over 10 years with another 4 before the next GE. People could spend countless time, effort and money to campaign against them and who knows, maybe you get them out in 2025 and Labour get in. Then what? You think a Labour (or even the Green Party) Government will lead to the rapid changes needed to decarbonise?

See, this is the problem with the climate change movement at the moment, too much rubbish and confusion about what steps should actually be taken right now. Sure, it'd be nice to get right wing governments like the Tories out and wipe Exxon off the face of the earth, but even if those things were achieved, we'd still be in a really shit place. 

Just focus on dealing with what we have and what can be done right now to decarbonise as fast and as much as possible. What does this mean?

,As l said l don't accept a rapid acceleration of sea level rise in the next 30 years. But you have found data that supports your outlook and that is fine by me.

,"Thank you for your honesty. In doing so you have exemplified the problem. Even in the face of irrefutable scientific data from proven technology some people will not change their world view.

That’s what those that accept the scientific evidence of dangerous climate change are up against in trying to get things changed in order to protect humanity.    
  
When presented with the fact that sea level rise over the past 27 years, measured in two different ways that validate the data, was more than what you accept as sea level rise for the next 30 years it is still not convincing. And that in the face of visual and measured information that visually confirm measured data showing that world ice is melting at a faster rate and global temperatures are rising at increasing rates.

,"You are drawing a long bow claiming l am putting civilisation and your children at a dramatic risk because l expect the sea level rise to remain relatively consistent over the next 30 years as it has been since measurements were taken. Maybe l should suggest you consider my previous comments regarding measurement errors when you conclude that sea level rise will accelerate to 6 or 7 times the recent historically rate. 

I'm all for individuals contributing their efforts and resources to support their own ideals. As l do. But l think when it comes to our governments or institutions, l think there are more important issues to concentrate on than a variation in CO2 concentrations.

I look from the outside at US, European and other Western politics and cultures and l see these deteriorating, seemingly unobserved, while they pursue a variety of ideological that are inevitably a consequence of fossil fuels. But only the cost and not the benefits."
,">You are drawing a long bow claiming l am putting civilisation and your children at a dramatic risk because l expect the sea level rise to remain relatively consistent over the next 30 years as it has been since measurements were taken.

It’s a lot more than just sea level rise. And sea level rise has not been consistent. It’s been rising exponentially over the past 45 years.

>Maybe l should suggest you consider my previous comments regarding measurement errors when you conclude that sea level rise will accelerate to 6 or 7 times the recent historically rate.

Sea level rise is measured with tidal gauges and satellites which agree on the amount of rise. In addition it can be approximated by measurements of ice melts and temperature rise which validates the direct measurements. So trying to say the measurements are off by 200% is just desperation on your part.

What historically rate are you talking about. It appears to be about 100 years. So why didn’t you pick 200 years or 1000 years or 30,000 years. What’s magic about 100 years. The most recent historical rate is the past 5 years or at least since satellites have been used for measurements. What’s wrong with that historical rate?

Using the past 100 years for calculating the rate is like riding in a car that is going 60 MPH and saying will it’s really only going 30 MPH because we started at 0 MPH when we were not moving. That’s not going to help a bit if you have a head on collision.

>I'm all for individuals contributing their efforts and resources to support their own ideals. As l do. But l think when it comes to our governments or institutions, l think there are more important issues to concentrate on than a variation in CO2 concentrations.

It doesn’t matter to the truth at all what people think. What matters is the evidence. And the evidence shows that destructive weather has already started and will only get worse causing catastrophic disruptions in financial losses along with human death and devastation.

Scientists have been saying for years that the IPCC is too conservative. Now the latest report from scientists around the world that just came out yesterday has finally gotten up to speed on how bad and how rapidly global warming is happening and that mankind will ignore it at it’s peril.

>I look from the outside at US, European and other Western politics and cultures and l see these deteriorating, seemingly unobserved, while they pursue a variety of ideological that are inevitably a consequence of fossil fuels. But only the cost and not the benefits.

It's not ideological, it’s in your face danger. The benefits are miniscule compared to the cost. The time for denial is over."

Some of these solutions are centuries old or older. Other techniques are much newer, and still in development, but being used successfully to grow crops in arid regions, even with increasing droughts and temperatures.

A few hundred years of records doesn’t set records in my opinion."
,"There is a hottest temperature on Earth every year, even during ice ages. This year's putative hottest so far is in Iran. Not clear what the significance is. Part of the reason we see more records is that we measure in more places and more often.

Now we've invented A/C units which actually heat up the outside air, meaning the cost of keeping cool, might include giving poorer neighbors heatstroke when they have to go outside or are homeless.

Some communities are stepping up their game to reduce their heat island effects, but building codes also need to change to keep up with climate change, and grants or other incentive systems need to be ramped up so that the more at risk groups in our communities don't cook in their homes.

In Europe I know a lot of elderly die during heat waves because our buildings were made for absorbing heat, not withstanding growing heatwaves. Where I currently live, I worry about the homeless and people with metal roofs who have no where to go during hot spells, *especially* with how few trees there are and dwindling water resources."

I understand that this graph is is from an article about Indias historical climate. 

>Understanding climatic changes of the Holocene Period (past 11,000 years) is crucial to assess the impact of global warming on the Indian environment. In the following discourse we provide an overview of climatic changes over the Indian subcontinent based on instrumental records (1813-2008 AD) and as reported by historians (600 BC-1800 AD), archaeologists (3000–600 BC), mythologists (8,000-3,000 BC) and palaeo-climatologists (prior to 8,000 BC).

It does agree with how l interpret global temperature ove the past 12,000 years or so. In that the last 6,000 years have been relatively stable. Certainly variations but the trend is flat."
,">slightly decreasing temperature.

So the cyclical temperature would have continue to decline. And there would have been no natural warming."
,"Well yes, the warming was going to always happen because ice ages are aberrations on the time scale of planets ecology from what I’ve read. And the warming is perhaps initiated and the processes accelerated by human actions. But the warming would always be coming. We influenced the starting point on that."
,According to what you said that graph is not global temperatures but local temperatures.
,It would have went back to a gradual decline until the rapid decrease kicked in several thousand years just like has happened like in every interglacial period.
,[deleted]
,"This particular graph is the global average temperature that the writers of this paper use. Because they are discussing Indias climate does not mean it only represents local India climate. 

>Understanding climatic changes of the Holocene Period (past 11,000 years) is crucial to assess the impact of global warming on the Indian environment.

l'm sure you have claimed before that the LIA and the medieval warm period and other variations were only local as well. If you suggest that the variations shown on this chart are only local as well, you should ask yourself why they coincide. 

Anyway, as l said, this graph represents how l accept the last 12,000 years of global climate have varied. I'm not surprised that you disagree."
,Has the increase in CO2 concentration saved us from this dire fate.
,"It’s relevant because it rounds out the reality of the situation as a whole. I can’t tell if these are clarifying questions or I want to win the logic argument questions. 

In terms of the planet’s ecology, polar ice caps are the exception rather than the rule. Is it better in the long run for humans to live on a warmer planet without polar ice caps? For all life? In the short run, it would be a rough transition, I acknowledge that. But in the long run?"
,">\-This particular graph is the global average temperature that the writers of this paper use. Because they are discussing Indias climate does not mean it only represents local India climate.

But in the introduction it distinctly says “*In the following discourse we provide an overview of climatic changes over the Indian subcontinent based on instrumental records (1813-2008 AD) and as reported by historians (600 BC-1800 AD), archaeologists (3000–600 BC), mythologists (8,000-3,000 BC) and palaeo-climatologists (prior to 8,000 BC).*”

That shows the graph is only about the Indian subcontinent. In addition the graph shows a temperature difference of up to 4C over the past 10k years and only climate deniers would believe that since the glacial periods only show a global 5-7C change from the interglacial periods.

>\-l'm sure you have claimed before that the LIA and the medieval warm period and other variations were only local as well. If you suggest that the variations shown on this chart are only local as well, you should ask yourself why they coincide.

There is not a scientific consensus on the reason or extent of the cold period. However at this time the best evidence suggest it was a combination of a long volcano eruption and a decrease in the suns radiation. It appears the drop in temperature was around 1C in Europe and it’s not clear if it was worldwide or not.

>\-Anyway, as l said, this graph represents how l accept the last 12,000 years of global climate have varied. I'm not surprised that you disagree.

Even that graph shows a gradual average decrease in temperatures since the exit from the last glaciation and zero indication that “We are also technically still in an ice age so this was going to happen no matter what.”"
,Well we had several thousand years to figure out something better than extreme warming.

Funny how it is the same graph that represents s other localised regions."
,You seem to respond quickly and l just wonder where you live. Me in Australia.
,"I don’t understand the point. And maybe I just need more clarification.
You could ask the same question given that hypothetical, but what do you mean by that statement? That temperatures in regards to human thriving are irrelevant? Is a warmer earth better for life in general or not? Does the human organism do better in overall more mild temperatures?"
,Not all localities have that same trend but a lot do. But then that’s what you would expect since the global temperature has actually trended slightly downward. It’s just that global variations don’t vary as much as local variations
,The US. I was just by my cell.
,">It’s just that global variations don’t vary as much as local variations

Yep. Like averaging eliminates variations."
,When you have cold areas and you have warm areas then averaging reduces the magnitude of the variations not necessarily the number.
Climate change: Potential to end humanity is 'dangerously underexplored' say experts,
,"I mean, what do people think the phrase ""existential crisis"" means when referring to climate change?"
,"My take:


It's very important to look at it as a threat to humanity, but it's important to remember that it's not set in stone. We still have time so we've gotta keep optimistic and keep fighting or these issues are going to keep getting worse. But at this rate, it's looking like the next decade is going to be rough. Mass migration, extreme weather and reliance on air conditioning are in our future. And a lot of poorer communities are on track to fall. So this is why it's important to keep fighting oil companies and protecting these communities that are vulnerable.


We need to show people the eventual end if we keep on our path, but we can do this. It'll be difficult but we can do this. So don't give up if you see stuff like this, it's just a possibility"

A sub can discuss the issue at hand, and possible ways to adapt and mitigate (and to dissect what is going on around us) and still acknowledge that if left unchecked, it will only cause greater and more widespread suffering.  The point is though, why have an entire sub to just repeat that aspect? That part is already understood. I find it a better use to keep up with current studies and possible solutions."

,"while we **can** *adapt* to most hostile conditions, we *do not choose* to live in the most hostile conditions preferentially.  Instead we tend to seek out the most moderate conditions when given the choice.  That's far more relevant to the climate crisis."
,"Scenario 1 | We take aggressive action now and it turns out that climate change wasn't such a big threat: The downsides are that it costs a nice chunk of money in the short-term. The upside is that we have a more resilient and cheap form of energy long term, and likely created more jobs in the process.

Scenario 2 | We don't take aggressive action now and it turns out that climate change IS an existential threat: The downside is that we have just made our ONLY home in the universe significantly less suitable to human life, have caused untold suffering to humans and all life everywhere, and likely have crashed our economies for the long-term. The upside is....?

It's an easy decision to make, the math is straightforward. Limited downside and substantial upside to taking action now, massive downside and no upside to doing nothing."

,"Industrialized society is human society, I’m pro-human, it works for us.  The planet is just fine.  I like my Tesla."
,There is a ton of information online if you want to learn more!
,"From Wikipedia, on the book I am guessing you are referring 

""While the book is not focused on solutions, it recognizes solutions exist to prevent the worst of the damages: ""a carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy; a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet; and public investment in green energy and carbon capture"".[""

So, preventing the worst of the damages - would this not be a solution by way of mitigation?   

Again, I am not arguing that things won't get worse even with active intervention. Even the effects we see today are horrible, and will only worsen until we effectively reduce emissions. But what I am arguing is your claim of ""the climate apocalypse is here and we can't stop it"". I will continue waiting for any sort of scientific source on that one."
,Warning: DO NOT FEED ANY BEASTS IN THE PARK
,Soy is a plant that needs production too.
,We can technically stop it but we definitely won’t. Our emissions are continuing to increase
,Are trolls beasts?  Asking for a friend.
,"Algae, beet leaves, insects, and too many other things to list. It’s not only made out of soy."
,"That's speculative on human nature.   I wouldn't say ""definitely"" either way. Emissions are increasing, but activism is increasing too.  Bills to reduce emissions are being discussed, green energy has never been more popular and imo most importantly we have a generation of young people who understand their future is being destroyed.  Climate science is becoming more mainstream, more people are aware - I think there is a chance we do mitigate and give this existential threat the attention and resources it deserves. There is also a chance we won't. We are creatures of comfort, for sure. But we also are programmed to survive. With how many events are in the news now, I think the pressure for meaningful change will only increase.   What I think bears repeating though is that climate doom or apocalyptic certainty is another method used to promote climate inaction - it's slowly shifting from denial, to ""it's too late anyway so don't bother"" - which is just a new flavor of the same disinformation."
,It doesn’t matter what the common people want. Governments and corporations have to change and that will never happen fast enough
,"I can see you have a very strong belief of this, but I offer just a few final points 

1) make sure your belief is rooted in the science itself. Good or bad doesn't matter, the veracity of the claims is what matters. It's easy to both downplay or to exaggerate to hyperbole on what is going on - news articles are meant for clicks, not education. A downside of this is that negativity is much easier to sell than positivity, especially in this realm. And the current situation makes that easy - in fact it's hard to overstate the issues we will face - but that is all the more reason to make sure you are rooted in the science itself and not editorialized stories in either direction.

2) progress can be made. I will point again to the growing industry for green energy and the climate action even manchin has signed on for (it's not enough, of course , but it's a start) that meaningful change can haplen and is happening. The only way to ensure that meaningful change doesn't happen is to give up and say it's too late anyway."

No. We don't have viable substitutes for most of our transportation needs yet. I'm all for electric vehicles, but let's be realistic.

The discussion always seems to start at the end of the process rather than at the start.

*addition. To try and answer your question about welcoming petroleum use that is not retrograde, I do not know what that use looks like, but am open-minded.

A good strategy I've found for talking to conservatives.,"Hi all. I'm a trucker and I tend to talk to a lot of mostly rural conservative people. One thing I've found to be really effective in raising the alarm about climate change is to bring up last winter. I'll say something like ""hey did you guys have the crazy winter we had where it was warm one week and cold the next?"" ""it was 70 on Christmas day in Kentucky"" and listen to what they say. Then leave it off with just saying that it's worrisome or ominous without using any of their trigger words, like ""global warming"". The reply is usually thoughtful and kind."
,"Really good advice this. Confirms the extensive research which demonstrates that when directly challenged about their views or, worse, made to feel stupid because of their views, people will double down and, if anything, their opinions will harden."
,"In 1966 the Lexington area of Kentucky was 26F on the 3rd of December, 66F on the 8th, 31F on the 13th, 54F on the 18th, and Christmas day was 31F. Sure sounds like a strange December. 

Both the 1960s and this decade fall in the middle of extended periods of La Nina. The previous period of 1975-2000 was El Nino dominant giving nice warm and stable weather. 

My data source: https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate"
,"I prefer not to use weather to argue about climate. They are two different things, for the most part. It's true that climate change can make rare weather events more likely so some fraction of unusual weather is due to climate change, but that's a pretty abstract statistical argument."
,How about: shouldn't we get energy from windmills and solar instead of buying oil from Islamic states like Iran?
,"I'm very Independent, politically. In some ways I lean very Conservative, in others I'm a ""bleeding-heart liberal.""  I have no problems talking to Conservatives about anything. Generally, even when they disagree, I can have a civil conversation where each of us gets to make our points, and often we find that we agree more than we disagree.

When I talk to Liberals about anything they deem to be a Conservative issue, I generally find that they attack, then shut down any opposing argument with insults.

On the subject of Climate Change, I find that most Liberals' grasp of the situation is ""Carbon is bad, because Scientists say so, and you're not smarter than Scientists.""  This is a pretty weak debating tactic, being a classic Logical Fallacy, but that's where we are.  Oh, there are plenty of Conservatives who's best argument is ""it's all a hoax"" or ""the scientists are all in it for the money"" or something.  Just as bad, just as clueless.

Still, if you MUST try to talk to Conservatives about climate change, do it with a clear goal in mind.  Are you trying to convince them that GHGs are really warming the planet?  Know what you're talking about, then. Don't try to bully them with Scientists say so.

Seriously, millions of Liberals want change, but would fail a physics test questioning the science behind atmospheric radiation absorption and emission. They don't know why, but they argue as if you're stupid for not believing something they themselves don't understand.  If you want a Conservative to change what he is personally doing, you've got to give him good reasons for changing his behavior.  If you just want him to vote for your candidate, Climate Change is not going to be your best platform."

,As I understand the effects of la niña are exacerbated by heat
,You're right but it's a way to make people think about the problem. When a lot of (older) people i know saw that a big amount of trees couldn't handle the heat wave in summer and had to be chopped down they suddenly believed in climate change. All the statistics and arguments weren't successful but that did it. Even if this specific heat wave wasn't due to climate change I'd still use it to spread awareness
,That is true but you kind of have to meet people where they are at. Someone whose reasoning faculties have been damaged by exposure to conservative lies usually don't have any good responses to reasoning because they base their responses off of direct observation and emotion. Once you can convince them something is wrong with the weather you can slowly change their thinking about green energy or global warming. Baby steps are important for the indoctrinated.
,"You are right but what OP is doing is communicating with them in the way they think about climate. Conservatives think weather and climate are the same or at least they conflate the two. OP is drawing attention to the change in weather patterns, which is a piece of climate change.

,"Can you show me actual science that shows average storm energy has increased over the last 1000 years?  Short term changes (last 30 years) are not convincing, because we know that there were horrific storm cycles 60 years ago, or 100 years ago, etc.

We also know that horrific droughts have occurred more than 30 years in the past. The Dust Bowl drought that caused the great migration out of the central plains of the US to California occurred before we started really ramping up CO2 emissions. Half of the emissions we've ever emitted have occurred after the year 2000, and yet we had droughts and hurricanes and ice storms and killing heat waves well before then.

Also, history may well have ignored terrible weather systems back over 150 years ago in places that were sparsely populated. Why ""study"" storms that occur in places where only a couple of hundred people live, when we've got hundreds of thousands living on the coast?

So, focusing on ""a wild storm"" and insinuating that it's mankind's fault that the storm is bad is really just short term thinking, without any actual science to back it up.

And yeah, I know we have droughts.  We have areas of the US now that are in drought.  But, we know that changing climate conditions drove the Native American civilization that had been flourishing in the American Southwest to abandon long-held settlements and move away - a thousand years ago. Man caused climate change, even back then?"
,"We're just interested in the energy from the fuel and obviously that could come from cleaner sources. really what trucking has opened  my eyes to is the sheer amount of fuel used and the inefficiency of the machines.

I recently encountered a climate change denier in the wild and thought, “You know what, there are plenty of reputable sources out there that agree that climate change is real and being caused by humans. I’m going to collect a list of those sources and show them to this person.”

So I did, and I wanted to share this mega list with you, to better arm you to help people accept what is happening to our planet. So here goes:

,"Thanks for putting this up.

Personally, I have no doubt about our role in climate change issues. However, I have come across some arguments like:

""Humans have nothing to do with it, it natural cycle - sun spots and what not"".

""increasing level of CO2 is harmless. Anthropogenic contribution is negligible""

&#x200B;

Can you please share any  links that address above specific points?"
,Thanks for this comprehensive list
,"The problem with just calling it climate change is that people will latch onto how the climate has always been changing, which is true. What most people don't realize is that when we talk about climate change today, what we are referring to is anthropogenic climate change. I really, really think that in order to start changing some people's views is to change from just calling it climate change and call it by it's true name. That way the distinction between the two is made and is harder to deny. I could be wrong but it's worth a try.

I just mean, that if someone posted saying ""here's 10 links saying that gravity is not just a guess but a well grounded theory"" then people would go ""well no shit sherlock"" etc. But climate change, it's like... Even if people didn't exist on the surface of our lovely planet the climate would still be changing. Climate is in constant change, no matter what is done to the earth. Now, what we want to discuss is whether humanity has been responsible for the rapid increase of warming these last years (meaning, hundreds of years) - not whether the climate changes or not.

I guess I don't really like the term climate change denier... But I guess, it wouldn't be as sexy to go around and say ""I'm not entirely convinced that humans are responsible for a larger proportions of emissions than we previously thought""."
,"Sources are nice, but there are plenty of reputable sources that claim the opposite. The only thing to be proven is that there is no agreement on the issue. Also, using snopes or the U.S senate as reputable sources seems very dumb. 

https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf

"" For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. ""

"" There is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent due to the incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change and low confidence in estimates of natural internal variability in that region ""

"" There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale ""

"" There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations ""

"" There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause ""

"" it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century, ""

So the IPCC itself says that there are no more flooding, hurricanes, droughts due to our Co2 emissions. They acknowledge that the Antarctic ice is constant or even growing. And the sea level will not rise a meaningful amount even in the next eighty years.

But there is more:

It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.

AR5 has a temperature graph SPM1a on page 3, where the temperature seems to have increased about 0.6 degrees C between 1951 and 2010, and basically they do not know how much of that is human caused, but it may be no more than half, so 0.6*0.5 = 0.3 degrees C. That is a far cry from the 0.9 degrees that the earth has warmed since 1850 according to the instrumental record, the IPCC is only claiming a third of this for ""anthropocentric"" Co2 emissions!

So what about the future?Well for the future temperature scenarios they need to use their models. But:

"" For the period from 1998 to 2012, 111 of the 114 available climate-model simulations show a surface warming trend larger than the observations (Box 1.1, Figure 1a). ""

So the IPCC themselves acknowledge that the models are running hot.

The IPCC has a separate section on the their model quality, .and they state

""The causes of both the observed GMST trend hiatus and of the model–observation GMST trend difference during 1998–2012 imply that, barring a major volcanic eruption, most 15-year GMST trends in the near-term future will be larger than during 1998–2012 (high confidence; see 11.3.6.3. for a full assessment of near-term projections of GMST). The reasons for this implication are fourfold: first, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas concentrations are expected to rise further in all RCP scenarios; second, anthropogenic aerosol concentration is expected to decline in all RCP scenarios, and so is the resulting cooling effect; third, the trend in solar forcing is expected to be larger over most near-term 15-year periods than over 1998–2012 (medium confidence), because 1998–2012 contained the full downward phase of the solar cycle; and fourth, it is more likely than not that internal climate variability in the near-term will enhance and not counteract the surface warming expected to arise from the increasing anthropogenic forcing. ""

So the IPCC have issued a very concrete short term prediction for the global warming from 2012 to about 2025-2030 where they are basically doubling down on the validity of the high co2-sensitivity of their models, and even using the term ""high confidence"". If global warming from 2012 to 2025 does not get back to the pace predicted by the models, then you can use the IPCCs own statements (""high confidence"") to refute them, they have really put their reputation and credibility on the line.

I feel like when talking to alarmists, I spend alot of time basically arguing to try to convince alarmists of things that I now realize the IPCC has already stated. I guess this is probably because noone actually reads the IPCC reports. So a good tip is to just quote the IPCC for these claims.

tl;dr:

The jist of the IPCC report is that they acknowledge that nothing much has happend yet, and even less of what has happend can be attributed to CO2, and the dire predictions rest solely on models that they themselves acknowledge are running too hot."

,"Yeah... sadly I think you’re right. But I also have heard some deniers say that they don’t believe there’s very much scientific evidence of it. This list could help disprove that, and maybe at least get them thinking.

The follow up question could be, “If climate change is fake, why do all these scientific and government agencies say it’s real?”"

It's pretty simple actually:

-Work in a coal/oil/gas company and don't want to loose your money.

-Have a good live and don't want to change because that's stressfull.

-Want to be the cool ANTI-MAINSTREAM guy.

But on a serious note: That's not how Science and humanity at all should work. If one could prove Einstein wrong, Albert would have been very pissed, but in the end aknowledged it."
,My next door neighbor is a climate denier. She is a retired school teacher and reads the Wall Street journal as her primary news source. I was surprised to find out her bias due to her intelligence and fair-mindedness. Says more about the Wall Street journal than anything. I shared a shorter list with her than the excellent one you have created and to her credit she is now on the fence. I suspect the sheer terror of leaving an inhospitable world behind for her grandchildren precludes her from completing the thought process.

I'm confused.  Why is this an issue to you or anyone?  

Snopes fact-checked a site that was obvious parody _to you and me._  It's quite likely it wasn't so obvious to others.

,">""Humans have nothing to do with it, it natural cycle - sun spots and what not"".

I might be naive and am stuck in my own echo-chamber, but I would say most, well, if not deniers so at least ""skeptics"", that I know of say stuff like ""humanity are accelerating the global warming, sure, but it's not as serious as most people would like to think it is.""

Again, I may very well be wrong."
,"The majority of the scientific institutions linked to above address those points. Or at least they address that climate change is being caused by human CO2 production.

,"Agreed. I sort of hope that this list can make its way to those people who are on the fence, and looking for evidence. And maybe even make the die hard deniers stop and think.

,"I personally agree with you on this, although I'll probably have to take a downvote or two for it (I'll consider it an experiment).

Myself, for example, I think that climate change is real - sure! I think it is a real threat to humanity - sure! I think that humanity is responsible for a big part of the drastic acceleration of global warming these last hundreds of years - sure! I don't think that humanity is responsible for all of it. But that doesn't make it less real. I still think we should change our ways.

It's weird really, this is such an amazingly big and overwhelming question that public debate should allow more than 2 points of view. Saying either you're in or you're out can prove dangerous in the long run. Although, I must admit: it's probably easier to market as a concept if there's only 2 sides of the argument. Good guys vs bad guys."
,"How else would you characterize the rejection of a vast body of scientific evidence without offering any alternative explanation except for some flimsy fantasy? Examples include, but are not limited to: it’s the sun, it’s not happening, climate is hard, it’s cosmic rays, the ice sheets aren’t melting, it’s all natural, co2 is good for plants, co2 is only a trace gas, it’s actually cooling, models are wrong... or some other gormless twaddle.

&#x200B;

The same science that tells us the climate changed in the past (and why it changed)  tells us that humans have caused the current climate change by adding more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It seems like you are trying to simultaneously accept and reject climate science. 

Instead, I'm going to ask - if increasing CO2 didn't cause the observed warming, why didn't it? What mechanic prevented this CO2 from doing what CO2 does? 

And if greenhouse gases didn't cause the recent warming what did?"
,"> It is obvious that climate change is real

No it's not to many - down here in Australia we have an elected federal Senator who maintains that all temp records have been fudged by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (a wanker called Malcolm Roberts)

The temp data sets have to be calibrated against each other and outliers have to be discarded (eg a thermometer that has broken). This is basic science, however fiddling with the record is like changing paragraphs in the old testament for some. And it's easy to see how the vociferous 'leaders' of the deniers can point to legitimate alterations of data and cry conspiracy"
,"Of course no climate scientist would deny that the climate has changed before humans existed. That's not the issue. The climate is changing faster than it ever has, and human activity is driving it. That's the issue."
,"From climate.nasa.gov

As usual, it comes down to this.  On one side I have NASA, the UN, the US Geological Service, a host of other respected institutions, and 97%+ of climate scientists.  

On the other side, I have some anonymous person on reddit who is essentially claiming that all these groups are deliberately lying - but offers no proof.

Tell me - why would any rational person not go with the overwhelming consensus of science?"
,"I’m not trying to credit climate change to anything. I’m just linking to what NASA, MIT, WHO, NIH and other sources have to say about it.

None of them are crediting “one source to a spectacularly complex system” but **all** of them agree that climate change has been made much worse by humans and carbon emissions.

When so many major, independent. scientific organizations are in agreement, it means the science behind it is sound, and we need to pay attention."
,"These sources also prove that humans have caused climate change beyond anything the world has ever seen.

From the NASA source:
> In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.
The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million in the last 150 years.

Same answer as everything else inconvenient - ""It's a conspiracy to misrepresent the real world."""
,"I think a lot about cases such as this one.

I neither know your neighbor or read WSJ, but has she herself said ""I *am* a climate change denier"" or is she making sweeping statements such as ""we don't know for sure"" or ""part of it may be man-made, part of it is probably not""?"
,I see that being the opposite. Anytime I bring up snopes they claim it has a liberal bias and is fake news.
,"Did you even read what I posted? Their methodology is definitely questionable. And not to mention, no one in their right mind would believe an article titled, ""Democrats Demand Kavanaugh Submit To DNA Test To Prove He's Not Actually Hitler"" is legitimate. Snopes is liberally biased at best, and propaganda garbage at worst. Anyone who considers them reputable, conservative or liberal is a tool."

Is there a short elevator pitch sort of? Some people just do not want to accept human effect. Or perhaps we need such people."
,Great point. Concept creep is a real threat.
,">Either you have to accept that NASA, WHO, NIH and MIT are completely incompetent scientists, or you have to accept that climate change is real.

Denialism is what youre doing when you willfully ignore what skeptics actually think and say."
,">The climate is changing faster than it ever has

That's incorrect. It's also not a prerequisite to taking action on present emissions and/or responding with other mitigation or adaptation measures."

,Then what would the climate be today if humans never existed?
,"I didn't say anyone was lying. Have another look at my comment. 

I said that the climate is spectacularly complex and that you seem to think only one influence ie humans, is responsible for any change. I wonder how many scientist would disagree with this."
,"We have a different understanding of what range of opinions scientist do have with regards to climate change. I am being specific here and saying scientist as opposed to what commentators, politicians and  activists claim scientists are saying. Or not saying, eg error margins and confidence in the statistics and methods used to gather and analyse data.

Edit. I think it would have been better to say ""different interpretation"" rather than ""different understanding"""
,"As a former libertarian, the counterargument would be the widespread harm they cause means they should be sued for reparations of the damage they have caused. But then again I gave that phase up quickly for a reason.

In practicality you need a good government to step in and stop corporations as when ones only goal is profit there is no depth that won’t be exploited to maximize returns. Responsible corporations without government and collective intervention are quite uncommon."
,"But a lot of climate change deniers aren’t willing to label themselves as a “conspiracy theorist”. So the only other explanation is that all these governmental and scientific agencies from all over the world are conspiring against the people of the world, and they plan for this conspiracy is to make us clean up the planet?? 

It just doesn’t make sense. And my hope would be that any people would see the issue here. And at least open their mind to the idea that human-caused climate change is happening.

But maybe it’s wishful thinking."

,"It’s explained in detail on [this page of NASA’s website](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)

Basically ecosystems are destabilizing all over the planet, and it’s only getting worse. Climate change, left unchecked will cause wide scale famines and food shortages, flooding in some areas, and droughts in others. Wide scale vegetation die off could cause another dust bowl. Hurricanes are already getting stronger and will continue to be more frequent and intense.

There are a lot of bad things that are already happening and it’s only going to get worse. 

If humans never existed, we wouldn’t have the current levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, which means the ecosystems wouldn’t be changing in all these bad ways."
,Nobody said that.
,"There isn’t really a range of opinions in the scientific community. 

To make this list, I googled “evidence of climate change” and took every single scientific or remotely credible source in the top 500 results, (most of them were news outlets who are useless in reporting on science).

Every single one of these institutions are in agreement. **All of them.**

And they agree that the main cause of climate change is carbon emissions made by humans.

Please read through some of them. They all agree. There is no range of opinions. Just independent scientific institutions, collecting and analyzing they’re own data, and all coming to the same conclusion.

If you can find a credible scientific institution that has a different opinion, I would be happy to read it. I like to learn and broaden my understanding of the world. But I have yet to find a credible scientific institution that says anything differently.

,"I began reading climate change literature about 20 years ago. Initially it was the mainsteam such as Tim Flannery, Michael Mann and others. A friend suggested reading counter arguments and lent me Prof Robert Carter, Christan Gerondau, Plimer, and l have continued reading on this topic. The Hockeystick Delusion by MacKintyre and McKitrick was particularly influential on me.  I'm currently reading The Climate Files by Fred Pearce. (I have a list with more details but typically l cant find it so what l have written and probably miswritten here is from my fading memory)

I am skeptical of the claims of impending disaster due to human influence and l base my skepticism on the counter arguments l have read. It is my personal opinion.

,"If you think that you are helping the environment wouldn't it be prudent to know the real facts behind the climate?... Without CO2 in the atmosphere this world dies.. That is an indisputable fact.. It's not entirely clear that CO2 causes the climate to change and at the level it is now (.04%) even the most die hard alarmist must admit that level is not enough to make even minor changes.... This world has existed with levels of CO2 at the 20 percent level in both times when their was an ice age and at times when the climate was hotter then it is now.. How do you explain that?...

Here are a couple of articles if you are interested.

,Feel free to give examples.
,"> My bias is toward crisis. A large body of evidence to support that position is available.

""Crysis"" is a totally subjective and vague term, as is ""being alarmed"". Thats political propaganda language, not science."

,You haven't noticed any yourself.
,The sources are the IPCC and the defense intelligence agency amongst others. I’m comfortable with that.
,"Look, you’re clearly so far down this rabbit hole that I doubt this will make any difference. But here goes.

Firstly, PopularTechnology.net is owned and funded by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). This is a UK lobbying organization funded largely by ExxonMobil and other oil companies, and has been discredited by the UK government, and banned from several government circles because of their impartiality and outright lies.

Secondly, approximately 90% of the studies on this list were funded directly by ExxonMobil. 

This company and website are a focused effort by ExxonMobil (not a scientific or impartial body) to convince people that CO2 emissions are safe so that they can keep making money.

Compare that to the NASA, the World Health Organization, the National Institutes if Health, M.I.T., and many other independent government and legitimate scientific agencies and an independent board of 1,300 scientists from around the world that have all confirmed that human CO2 emissions are causing climate change... and it’s clear what’s really happening. 

ExxonMobil is paying buckets of money to people to push their agenda while the scientific community proves over and over that humans are causing climate change.

Thanks for the debate. I’m done for now."
,NASA also says more CO2 means more heat.
,"You know very well that those are extreme edge cases from those reports. Those are right up there with supervolcanoes and dinosaur killer asteroids. If you want to be taken seriously, consider the likely cases, not the edge stuff."
,"Well, If you want to, ""Put on your tinfoil hat"" I could say the same thing about all the government funded organizations that receive funding directly for trying to prove that humans have anything to do with the climate.. 

What better way to receive funding then to get it directly from the source. If you make up a conjecture to illicit money directly from the government and say that there is a, ""crisis"" Then obviously, its more profitable to to do so.

Exxon, on the other hand believes in human caused climate change. They are even putting out commercials stating this. 

So, Why would an organization that invests in commercials in order to prove AGW, be against it?"
,Again.. The Earth existed in an ice age when the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was at 20 percent.. We are at .04 percent now. How could this be?
,"What do you actually believe that every government and research university in the world is trying to achieve here, exactly?"
,They were never at 20%. They MAY have been as high as 6 or 7%. But the Sun was also dimmer back then. The Sun gains about 1% in luminosity for every 100 million years of age.

,"How do they all get that, exactly?"
,Right about what?
,Grants
,"*Grants???*

Lol. What a shitty get rich scheme. 

You must not know anybody who works in the sciences. 

Grants aren't shit dude. You'd be insanely better off just becoming a fast food restaurant manager than trying to make lots of money as a research scientist.

,"Clearly you do not understand what I said or what this thread was about. I was responding to a comment about how Exxon provides all the science funding for climate skepticism. I was demonstrating how their is more money to be found in government and that Exxon believes strongly in AGW. 

But convincing people like you is hopeless and pointless as you have deluded yourself so much that you clearly will believe anyone who supports your dissidence and demonize anyone who does not. You even resorted to an ad hominem to prove my point. 

It's not that you are stupid, It's just you know so many things that are not true."
,"Let's get this straight then...

You believe the people who were (verifiably) funded by an oil company.

You do not believe the scientists who work at universities because you think they created an entirely false field in order to secure grant funding.

It just doesn't make much sense. 

Then, on this other side, you have something that has happened again and again throughout history. A company with a product that science shows is harmful, hires scientists to mislead public opinion so they can continue selling it. 

It happened with leaded gasoline. It happened with cigarrettes. It happened with CFCs. It happens again and again. 

So why put so much faith in what once again.. has all the characteristics of a corporate disinformation campaign?"
,"I don't believe anyone or put my faith in anything for that matter. I find out exactly how something works and try to explain it to the best of my abilities. However, Overcoming ones paradigm is a near impossible task when it comes to a religion. It requires the same, ""appeal to authority"" as the authority is appealed against me. In this case, actual peer reviewed journals by reputable scientists. 

Plenty of alarmist scientists have been proven wrong in the past numerous times without any consequences. They have inaccurately predicted the end of the ice caps by the year 2000. They predicted time and time again the fall of civilization, always being wrong. Yet, to this day they still practice, ""science"" and receive funding. 

I can't convince you with all my facts.. I will never be able to show you exactly how the climate works because you would never understand and you have a closed mind. 

You already decided that you would just trust that some people are correct rather then doing the science for yourself. Even if it means that in doing so you are hurting the environment. 

You see.. You would do absolutely anything to be correct because your mind is already made up. The same goes with most people and unfortunately scientists too.. There is no mass conspiracy.. There is, however the need to be right.. 

I could take you step by step, giving you numbers and calculations, explaining each and every point. Proving those points with verifiable facts.. Not conjecture, not speculation, not false predictions... But you would never read them, All you want is for me to coincide to you that you are right.. I can't do that..

I myself don't care about being right.. I care about the verified facts being right and so far, the whole AGW cult is only backed by speculation, conjecture, and fear.. Why don't you read and study these peer reviewed journals for yourself if you really want to be right?"
,"So.. you keep saying you think I have a closed mind. I actually am a scientist. I'm an ecologist. 

I don't think that you have actual science that you are criticizing there (such as your icebergs prediction thing). 

I think what you've done is read blogs which have fed a carefully cherrypicked narrative, heard statements made in non-scientific contexts, as well as seen headlines which were incredibly misleading if you actually dig into them (such as the recent ""500 scientists write a letter to UN"" thing, where it turned out that there was actually only a total of 10 scientists with any relation to climate science, and only ~26 with any relation to any form of environmental science at all). 

I'd be truly surprised if you indeed did have peer reviewed research to back up your beliefs. 

Meanwhile, behind the ""scientists predicted and it didn't come true!"" sort of headline claims, we actually have models that have almost perfectly projected observed warming over decades, and a ton of solid research on this.

There's a reason that basically every scientific field agrees with the consensus. My field, ecology, is impacted by this phenomena to an insane degree. Others, such as geology, are intimately tied to it. You'd think that if a bunch of frauds were faking the entire concept, other legitimate fields such as mine would raise a red flag, especially when it impacts the real work that we actually do. 

So, go ahead and show me what actual research you possess. 

It better not be some fucking blog and YouTube channel."
,"> we actually have models that have almost perfectly projected observed warming over decades

Sorry to thread jump, but you really shot yourself in the foot here. When I created this sub a decade ago it was for the purpose of a dispassionate, rational dialogue on a divisive topic. Making demonstrably false claims like you have undermines such discussion a makes readers doubt your claim of being an ecologist."
,"No.. You are not a, ""scientist"".. A real scientist would of read the peer reviewed articles that I have posted. No need to inflate your ego... You are so desperate to be right that you will forgo even looking at the counter argument. You give in to all speculation and conjecture so much so that you ignore all facts. 

Science is not you or me being correct.. Science is the truth being correct.... I can point out all the peer reviewed articles from the past that actual accredited scientists published that predicted the end of the world.. But I won't because a real scientist would of looked them up for themselves on the academia web.

There's no statement in the abstract about projected versus observed warming. The only statement about fit is the term ""consistent,"" which is very broad when talking about models. The authors focus on hindcasts, which is very much NOT projected warming. Strike one.

The body of the article doesn't even state projected warming from the 1967 paper, thus the titular claim is completely unsupported clickbait.

>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming

First, I would suggest you not take the Guardian seriously on climate change. They have a notably alarmist bias. Second, the author hand-waved at a selection of models. That's ex post facto selection. 

So I'll state this again. I am trying to help you out here. Be careful with your language. Setting a standard of ""models that have almost perfectly projected observed warming"" puts you in an indefensible position, and your follow-up comment failed spectacularly in its effort to support that claim.

What's more, your claim isn't necessary to a productive discussion of climate change. In fact, it's counterproductive. It opens the door to criticisms like those I've just provided. If you were slightly more cautious in your words, there wouldn't be a need to go down this path."
,You are truly pathetic
We’ve already built too many power plants and cars to prevent 1.5 ˚C of warming,
,What a shit excuse. The world has come together to stop all sorts of crisis. We can easily do this.

,">The scientists conducted the study by pulling together global data sets tracking major carbon dioxide sources like power plants, vehicles, industrial boilers, and residential appliances such as furnaces and stoves. Together, they’d pump out about 660 billion additional metric tons of greenhouse gases from this point forward, well above the 580 billion tons that mark the top end of the estimated range for limiting warming to 1.5 ˚C.

Useful to have a firm number estimate on this. 

>Power facilities already in the pipeline—“planned, permitted, or under construction”—would emit nearly 200 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, the researchers found. Most of those impending facilities are in China, India, and the rest of the developing world.

>Emissions from existing systems plus these planned plants would add up to about 850 billion tons, closing in on the carbon budget for 2 ˚C, which runs between 1,170 and 1,500 billion tons.

More useful numbers. 

>But there’s little indication that nations, particularly in the developing world, will suddenly stop building fossil-fuel plants after completing what’s in the pipeline.

Kind of an abrupt end to an article like this, but okay.

Are these numbers sufficient motivation to get people focusing on local climate adaptations, given that emissions limits aren't going to be effective in this scenario?

I think probably not. But the local adaptations will continue to happen anyway, out of the glare of major public attention. 

And possibly that's the best possible situation. Let people who have no intention of actually doing anything focus on illusory goals like emissions limits. And let planners and engineers who DO choose to act...just do their thing, in an environment of sporadic public attention at most. 

Although I do think it's possible for a regulatory wave to sweep the world and limit coal consumption to something like 50% of today's consumption. I'm guessing that natural gas can replace half of the energy that's produced today by coal."

-global alignment/policy
-local participation/action and disproportionate micro economic impacts
-negative impact to GDP, overall macro economics of global policy
-effect on the 1.2Bn impoverished population reliant on fossil fuels to emerge from poverty
-mitigation technology while lagging heating effects persist 
-relocation of those suffering from localized impacts (sea levels etc, if they start rising substantially)
-availability of food and water

,"Yeah, sadly neither is world actually coming together to stop this crisis; I mean politicians talk, but the actions... not really there, and the saddest part is that the people most affected by this phenomena at this point in time are the people least responsible for it - meaning tiny islands in the middle of a Caribbean with no industrial production, just bit of tourism and fishing... which are loosing land mass basically every day, and deeply in their hearts already know they will have to move, but don't know where. And as of now, there is no international treaty that would guarantee any refugee status and protection to these climate refugees, and for some, sadly it should already be in place.

And some lifeforms make it thru global climate change no matter how severe it will be, and from these primitive lifeforms, higher lifeforms will probably develop over millions of years before our sun goes supernova and this planet truly disappears for good."

India may have more pressing issues, but I believe they may catch up with China in a reasonable time in order to afford the same luxury of writing off previous investments if their R&D investments materialize - or who knows, ITER will be a great success, the global community will throw money at engineering firms to have a commercialized version in 5 years time, and we will have 3, 4 fusion reactors per continent and never give a crap about fossil fuels for most applications ever again.

One more factor to consider though, in my opinion India is more vulnerable to global climate change impacts than China, so they may become more motivated to do something about the issue..."
,Thanks! This was a very helpful article. I suppose we will actually die after all.
,">Population increase is NOT a primary driver of climate change, btw.

True, to be more exact it's a primary driver behind the climate change drivers like increased energy demand, food demand (you do know that agriculture is the second biggest contributor to global climate change after energy production right?)."
,Maybe. we sure are taking a lot of rolls of the dice when it comes to 'possible' feedback loops etc.
,No. It isnt. Land use is. Agriculture is included in that.
," I think the 'maybe' is the most important thing to consider here. It's not an absolute given that the hydrate feedback loop will accelerate to immediate, deadly levels, but it's a possibility. It needs to be considered - respected - when we talk about the potential effects of a few decades' worth of procrastinating, and what a few more might do for literally everything we hold near and dear.   
I did find a blogging site called [climatetippingpoints.info](https://climatetippingpoints.info/) a while back, I think it put lots of the ongoing tipping points in perspective for me. It's done by Dr. David Armstrong McKay from Stockholm University, he does a great job condensing the tipping points our earth system has - that we know about, at least."

I provided more than enough information, linked my sources, you keep repeating the same argument, I don't know what more to highlight for you to understand the fact that the **EPA did segregation** of data from agriculture alone and poor land use and forestry practices, it's on their website as a world class researcher in the field you know how to find EPA website and probably also heard of research gate so feel free to link more detailed peer-reviewed papers.

I work in STEM, I have been published, if you speak the language [feel free to read my published work](https://www.abclinuxu.cz/autori/mark-stopka). But thus far you seem to me like a parent who as a last resort tried to use the ""I am a scientist argument"" while actually not having any STEM career at all, judging by the quality of arguments you've provided throughout this entire discussion."
,Agriculture is land use.
,"Yeah, I am really sure you work in STEM... /s"
,"You literally came here to be an asshole. Made a false statement. Got corrected then tried to make a new argument. Keep getting corrected and are still here. 

I don't have time to argue with you from a hospital anymore.

Land use is continued into agricultural practices, primarily in methane emissions from livestock.

But from your link...

> TThe current global average temperature is 0.85ºC higher than it was in the late 19th century. Each of the past three decades has been warmer than any preceding decade since records began in 1850.

Yes the ""TThe"" typo is on the website you linked! 

No it is not 0.85ºC, IPCC data says:

> A.1. Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.1) {1.2}

And really like I am tired of doing research for someone who claims that is an environmental scientist on an environmental topic, so why don't you [read the IPCC report yourself](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/)?

> Try not being such a douchebag and you might have kids one day too.

I am 100% certain I won't. 

You try to either do your research, or stop making unsupported arguments (and repeating them over and over again, when actually being informed that the data have been adjusted for what you use as the one single argument throughout the entire discussion), previously I have used EPA data, as I ALREADY SAID, this dataset has been adjusted for agricultural production for human needs and naturally occurring phenomena and impact of poor land management practices which you would know if you'd bother to either read what I quoted, or actually open the EPA website which contains the same information I've provided you with, but without HIGHLIGHTING the FACTS that THE DATA have BEEN ADJUSTED for THE ONLY ARGUMENT you used in THIS ENTIRE DISCUSSION.

During this entire conversation you've provided no reliable source of information, the EC website is a bloody joke for second graders, not something that someone with a STEM background would link in a serious conversation.

So do me a favor, admit to yourself you're no researcher and at least read some actual research on the topic from the links provided. The [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) provided for your convenience once again contains all the references to all used research, so if you do not believe IPCC, feel free to deep dive right in into those approx. 1k papers IPCC used to produce the report."

Cannabis production is generating large amounts of gases that heat up Earth’s physical climate. Moving weed production from indoor facilities to greenhouses and the great outdoors would help to shrink the carbon footprint of the nation’s legal cannabis industry.,
,"This is a poorly written TLDR of this research: ""[The greenhouse gas emissions of indoor cannabis production in the United States](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00691-w)""

The cannabis or it's growth isn't generating gases, it's creating and maintaining an indoor environment that has an energy cost.  Ostensibly any controlled agriculture would too.

>But cannabis production is generating large amounts of gases that heat up Earth’s physical climate.  
>  
>Jason Quinn and his colleagues at Colorado State University in Fort Collins looked at how much electricity and natural gas are needed in various states to grow marijuana in an artificial indoor climate, which allows for a consistent product in any weather. The researchers then calculated the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with this energy consumption."
,"Let's focus on the largest greenhouse generators. Like transportation, power generation, and various industrial operations."
,How would canabis production differ from vertical farms?
,Yet another argument to legalise it.
,Oh please...you have to pick your fights and this isn't it.
,"Not always feasible to grow outdoors, the climate must be controlled to a very precise degree."
,It also uses a shit-ton of electricity.  I know this from experience.  It is obviously better for the environment if it was just allowed to grow outside naturally.

,We need to pick lots of fights across lots of different fronts if we want to put a dent in climate change. It definitely makes sense to grow crops using sunlight instead of artificial light powered by fossil fuels
,"This isn't picking a fight, it's just a study."
,Or we switch to ways of doing things that doesn't hurt the climate. Such as using renewable energy to power electricity or growing plants using the renewable sunlight directly :)
,One stoner probably produces less CO2e in a year from canabis consumption than a typical car produces from a single tank of gas.
,Care to explain?  Why does growing 1 pound dry weight of canabis do something different than 1 pound dry weight of fancy lettuce?
,"No we need to leave that one alone and let it become what it needs to be... Legal, with no more hurdles.  I swear if you lunatics go after weed I'm buying a coal furnace."
,A worthless study that didn't need to be published...Researchers took the time to look into it so I would say that they are picking a fight or they wouldn't have bothered.
,"And that CO2 came from the carbon that was absorbed by the plant...

The carbon intensity of growing cannabis is from the electricity used and from the manufacturing of any climate control equipment. And maybe any petroleum based fertilizers. Not from its consumption."
,Cars should run on weed then...
,"Not sure what the comment you responded to said since it is deleted but I can actually speak to this. It is relevant to my job & everything. 

Vertical farms definitely use energy. No question. 

But generally speaking, growing typical crops in a vertical farming environment would require significantly less energy than indoor cannabis cultivation. 

Both would require energy for lighting & various other elements. Cannabis cultivation has begun using very sophisticated lighting made specifically for cannabis but let’s not even dwell on that since all the lighting is going to be LED in either application. 

Cannabis requires a *much* more controlled environment. 

Vertical farming can also require such, but so far the trend is generally to utilize existing structures & not depend on a very controlled environment. Many vertical farms are actually open air facilities without exterior walls. 

Cannabis is usually cultivated in facilities constructed with insulated metal panels (think refrigerator panels) which require steel facing, steel or aluminum extrusions, & a core material (such as polyisocyanurate). All of this traditionally requires significant amounts of CO2 to create. Even if you’re using largely recycled aluminum. 

Think of it this way, you can grow food crops pretty much anywhere (more or less). Cannabis is grown in the same facilities used for pharmaceutical cleanrooms. 

This is because again, cannabis needs a much more controlled environment without excess moisture, uncontrolled temps, specific air flow, etc. 

I’m not up to speed on the specifics of the energy usage, but I would be willing to bet that the power needed for a cannabis specific HVAC/filtration system is as much as is created by the lighting systems if not significantly more. 

Vertical crop farming generally does not need said level of air control. Saving a huge energy cost. 

This is not to mention that cannabis cultivation is WAY more than simply growing. There are many many ‘rooms’ or ‘environments’ involved. There are often 3 or 4 different controlled environments for growing stages plus a curing, trimming, & packaging facility. 

Crop cultivation is pretty much just grow & sometimes washing plus packaging. They may have two or three different environments for grow stages, but these don’t even require their own dedicated controlled environments many times. 

Sorry for rambling a bit. But I hope this helps demonstrate the difference. It is rather substantial from my understanding."
,I'm not anti weed? Calm down. I don't think legislation is what we would use anyway. Federal legislation would free more people to grow in the open. And some education on how to use greenhouses would teach people a better way of doing things
,"Bro, chill"
,Bio-gas from hemp isn't an entirely implausible idea
,"Thanks.  Good answer.

As far as I can tell VF is only a viable economic alternative when land is very expensive, product value high per pound dry weight, and product has a short growing cycle and is hard to transport, and product can use lots of hand labour.

Good examples would be lettuce, fresh herbs, possibly tomatoes.

If land is cheap, then green houses are cheaper.  

Products that get only 1 harvest a year (pears) are too expensive to produced.  Products that store well (wheat) are too much cheaper to grow in conventional farms.

The dryweight metric comes in due to energy cost per pound of carbohydrate produced.  Lettuce is 90% water so you are selling textured, flavoured water.  The energy cost is low per sales unit."
,"I know... I'm just saying, we are getting so close to full legalization that I just don't like seeing any negativity or nonsense that could be used to argue against it.  
I prefer greenhouses but outdoors isn't always viable depending where you live so lights are a good alternative.  I agree if it was legal most would move outside or into a greenhouse so really it's just something that didn't need bringing up IMO."

Thanks for clearing that up. Mind posting your sources about how the world has heated up drastically, and how life as we know it will be over in 12 years, and all the other bile that politicians and protesters are spewing?

Make sure you’re sitting down for this: the world is not melting and man-made climate change is a hoax. You, and people like you, are being exploited.

Remember this comment in the future when the world still has not ended.

Organisations and scientists have been saying things like this for literally decades. Every few years it changes: the world is heating up and humans face extinction! The world is cooling down and humans face extinction! I GUARANTEE YOU that within 5-10 years the status quo will change and the emergency will be something entirely different, when it becomes apparent that the climate change myth is unravelling.

Watch An Inconvenient Truth if you want to watch a movie that has not aged well.
Everything that Al Gore, your climate change messiah, said (this is not an exaggeration- LITERALLY EVERYTHING) has been proven false. His deadlines, predictions, they have either shown to have not occurred, or the exact opposite has occurred. Case in point being his assertion that the polar ice caps would cease to exist by 2015. The polar ice caps are currently larger than when he made that “documentary”. It may shock you to know that he made tens of millions of dollars from that movie alone. Let that sink in- he made tens of millions of dollars by fearmongering and scaring gullible people like you.
If politicians and the wealthy elite, such as him, were genuinely concerned that the world was ending, why are they hoarding their money and making movies about it to generate obscene amounts of personal wealth? Like actually try and answer that i’d love to hear your opinion.

,We will all be dead 😆
,Definitely may take longer than it needs to and honestly if we don't keep up the demand for change which a lot of people admittedly do when they think that change is happening and they let their guard down it could backfire before we knew it and they're aiming for 2050 no we need to hit this by 2030 now that's the main thing that I see the problem with this but we need to be louder push for more which we know they can do we just got to push harder and harder
,lol - that'll depend on how hard they try to achieve the goal😆
,Moreso as rural populations continue to shrink.
,As long as we keep shouting screaming at them to do something and keep this up the moment we give up and start becoming content thinking that everything is okay that's when they'll stop so we must not stop yelling at them that this is something that needs to be done.
,"Those solar panels are covering the area of a small uranium mine, not to mention the infrastructure surrounding it."
,"It changes the eco system, that's true. But there's vegetation below solar panels. On top and below of nuclear plants there's typically nothing. But maybe I see it too negatively; after all, the area around Fukushima and Tschernobyl have become a truly remarkable natural habit without humans. For... reasons."
,😂 or those old politicians making promises will be dead by then
,No nihilistic thinking the moment we start to pretty much convince ourselves that there is no chance that there is nothing left that there's nothing we can really do that's the moment we've truly lost and that there is no way we're going to make it we don't need that I believe we should only give up when it absolutely is over.
,"> honestly if we don't keep up the demand for change which a lot of people admittedly do when they think that change is happening and they let their guard down it could backfire

This is quite foreseeable."
,Is it the majority that are shouting and screaming.
,And still require fossil fuel for backup.
,I prefer humans.
,It is absolutely over.
,"Unless of course we have chosen a path that is leading us, with all of our energies, in a direction that cannot solve the problem.  That is exactly what we are doing with wind and solar.  It's like a bucket brigade on the Titanic, great intentions, wrong solution.  We either go nuclear or we accept what is coming."
,It pains me how accurate that is and you're not wrong it's hard to keep people going when it doesn't work the first time or when they suddenly have a sense of assurance that oh it's working out we don't need to try anymore that's real difficult it's kind of a real nightmare to just keep it going but we have to keep trying for however long we have
,No sadly it's not enough which is why we need more people to join in it's just hard to convince people to change their lifestyle because well it's literally how most of us have lived our entire lives think about it how easy do you think you could really change some little details or big details of your life without feeling a little offended or annoyed.
,What do you think backs up nuclear power?
,"You’re still posting here so obviously not.

Edit: There’s no fixing or turning the problem around but there’s still the potential to mitigate risks and potential hazards/crises."
,">it's just hard to convince people to change

And be convinced to change."
,Good question.
,Hopefully a neighboring nuclear power plant.
,So nuclear power can use nearby nuclear power as a backup but solar can't use nearby solar and wind as a backup?
,"No, the sun and wind are totally unreliable.  Maybe someday batteries will fill the gap, but, the amount of mining for that much battery backup has got to be on par with coal at least."
,"Sun and wind are reliable and predictable.  They are intermittent however.

>the amount of mining for that much battery backup has got to be on par with coal at least.

No, the amount of material for 100 TWh of batteries is about 5 billion tons.  And the material in the batteries is not burned, it is recycled at end of life. The world mines 72 billion tons of Coal each decade, the world extracts 42 billion tons of oil per decade."
A third of the Earth's population will live in arid regions by 2070,
,"Thankfully, this is if emissions continue to rise. You're starting to see more and more action these days: its slow, and right now it isnt enough, but it is definitely ramping up and becoming more noticeable. Hell, I'm seeing ads for carbon reduction that I never would have thought would be a thing even five years ago.

,Nope. In general the ones living in fucked up places are only causing a tiny fraction of the global emissions. And then there are some nice and rich places where people tend to have fewer children while doing a lot to destroy this planet.
,"He's not wrong though. We are doing something to mitigate climate change. Whether it'll be enough is a different question and down to personal opinion at this point in time as I'd wager neither of us own a crystal ball.

On top of that, the study (that wasn't linked in the article) is based on the so called ""business-as-usual"" assumption (RCP 8.5) which is very unlikely at this point.

But even in our current emissions projection there are still difficult challenges to face so it's important to bring them to light and find viable solutions to them instead of responding with optimistic lip service or misplaced pessimism."
,Thanks. Let's just hope we do enough though. We can never give up. We can never let Earth down. Never gonna run around and desertify it. We have to look after this planet because we all live here and we can't live without it.

That’s not science that’s manipulation of relevant data. So instead of using temperatures taken at their peak they chose a time of day which was cooler by anywhere from 1.5-5 degrees Fahrenheit.

I highly recommend checking out Tony heller on YouTube or his website, real climate science.com

* Claims that we're at record low temps somehow.
* Thinks ""global warming"" was changed to ""climate change."" Doesn't seem to know that global warming causes climate change.
* Points out throughout history that the planet as gone through periods of warming much higher than today, therefore it's natural (yet doesn't acknowledge extinction events occurring during this periods) so therefore there's nothing to worry about.
* Claims government groups that monitor the climate are fake groups.
* Claims that climate change is a hoax, specifically ""fake news.""
* Claims they want to help the environment.

They won't read into any of the real science because they've been conditioned to believe that it's all fake, therefore the only sources that are reliable to them are the ones which claim it's all a hoax.

,"Not necessarily. Sometimes, it can take years, decades, or centuries before ""everyone"" is on board the truth about an issue or idea. Some people never accept the truth before coming to the ends of their lives.        
        
For example, in the 6th century BC, Greek philosopher and mathematician [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) of Samos (c. 570 BC - c. 495 BC) and other early Greek philosophers speculated the Earth was not flat because they reasoned it  had a spherical shape.  
         
The idea of a spherical Earth widely remained a matter of speculation until the 3rd century BC, when Hellenistic astronomy established the spherical shape of the Earth as a physical fact and calculated the Earth's circumference.  
         
The paradigm gradually was adopted throughout the Old World during Late Antiquity (c. 280 AD - c. 650 AD) and the Middle Ages (c. 400 AD - c. 1600 AD). In general, Chinese society didn't subscribe to the idea of a spherical Earth until the 17th century.  
         
A practical demonstration of Earth's sphericity was achieved by Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano's circumnavigation (20 Sep 1519 – 6 Sep 1522). Their fleet sailed from Spain with 5 ships and between 230 and 270 men, circumnavigated the world, and returned to  Spain nearly 3 years after their departure. When they returned to Spain, only [1 ship and 18 men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan%27s_circumnavigation) were remaining in the fleet.      
       
After Pythagoras and other Greek thinkers reasoned the Earth was spherical, around 2,100 years passed before all  world civilization generally came on board to accept the idea Earth has a spherical shape.  
        
Some people living today and born tomorrow think and will think anthropogenic global warming and climate change are a hoax or not facts until the day they die, including some within  the current average monthly number of [330 million](https://www.redditinc.com/) active Reddit users. However, around the world, most people alive today and born tomorrow already know or will come to know sometime during their early childhoods that anthropogenic global warming and climate change are real like they already know or will come to know the Earth is spherical.

,"\>  Tony does amazing at citing his sources and references.

Right - and you've checked for yourself that what he says about his sources is correct? And you've checked that his math is solid?

I've looked at his work in the past. Back then, I found that he was flatly averaging station data across the US to get the US average. And that is *bad,* like, real bad, mathematically. If you want a spatial average of temperature anomaly across the US, you have to adjust for the spatial area that each station covers, and you also have to baseline the stations so that your anomaly is correct.

Here, let me give an example: say you want to calculate the average anomaly from 1950 to 2019. And say in 1950, you had 100 stations in Florida, and 1 in each other state. And then, by 2020, the distribution of temperature-monitoring stations had shifted, such that you had 100 stations in Montana, and 1 in each other state. As Montana is colder than Florida, if you simply flat-averaged all of the stations together, your result would be incorrectly too warm in 1950, and too cold in 2020. Stations should instead be averaged by how much *area* they cover, and this correctly handles changes in the density of stations in a given area.

And yes, in the real world, in the last \~80 years we've shifted a bunch of temperature stations from the South to the northern US, so this example isn't just made up. It's a real, applicable way you can skew the data if you do the math wrong.

This was one of the mistakes that Heller used to make pretty regularly, and he'd double down on it when challenged. He didn't really care about whether his math was right, so much as whether he could use his results to bludgeon climate science. And boy, was his math wrong.

So that's why I ask if you've *really* checked his math for yourself. If you stand by his work, you'd damn sure better have checked it."

,"Eeek. 

Your link says the *atmosphere* is treated as locally flat. 

But if you say the climate models use a flat Earth, then that implies they also treat *sunlight* as if it were on a Flat Earth; the Sun above the surface of the entire Earth laid out like a table, rather than sunlight hitting the Earth with normal day/night cycles. And with sunlight coming in close to the horizon in polar regions. The whole shebang. 

The models definitely do *not* treat the planet as flat, not with regard to sunlight angles across the latitudes nor with regard to day/night cycles. 

Gonna have to give this one a ""false"""

,"I´m not the author of this text. So, I would suggest you go and contact Michael J. Prather and Juno C. Hsu, the authors and tell them why they are wrong.

If you are an expert, go ahead and ask them."
,"Huh? I read the paper itself, the one you linked.

That paper does not say that climate models simulate the (entire) Earth as flat. It says they simulate the atmosphere and surface as ***locally*** flat. Those are two very different things. I.e., flat within a given grid cell, not flat across the entire planet.

I believe you're misinterpreting their research. Here is the relevant quote from their paper:

>While many of the original approximations have since been improved, one—that the Earth’s surface and atmosphere are locally flat—remains in current models."
,"""Our image of the atmosphere from space is that of a thin layer wrapped around the Earth: we see it as curved but thin enough so that locally, it can be treated as flat. In most all climate models, the 3D grid composing the atmosphere is tied to a 2D flat surface grid whose shape and area extends through the atmospheric layers to a subjective top-of-atmosphere height, typically 80 km for climate modeling. A simple picture of the spherical atmosphere and its flattened form is shown in Fig. 1.""

We are talking about the global system."
,"\>  We are talking about the global system.

Right, and globally, the Earth is treated as spherical.

Here's an image of what an actual model grid normally looks like:[https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models)

Importantly, the grid as a whole is still spherical from an ""outer space"" perspective. The planet is round, with half of it being exposed to sunlight at any given time. At the poles, the light still comes in near the horizon. Etc. These are the most important aspects of a round, spherical Earth vs a Flat Earth.

What your paper is talking about is the *local* conditions. Locally, a grid point in the model has a flat top, a flat bottom, and intersects with its neighbors at right angles. This is still something that needs to be fixed, and I appreciate the authors pointing out how this affects things like the absorption of light in the upper atmosphere.

But while this is a valid problem that needs to be worked on, it is definitely *not* the same as ""models treat the Earth as flat"", because that would imply that they treat the Earth as flat in *all* aspects. Like, what you'd imagine when you talk about a Flat Earth. No night or day, no poles, etc. Mathematically and physically, these are two very different things."
,"> still something that needs to be fixed

When? Who is going to tell **the public** there has to be ""fixed"" a little bit here and a little bit there. We paid billions for this, we are going to pay even more money, the kids are going crazy. Our industry is going down. Remember: It´s all settled science, 97% agree, no one talks to the ""deniers"" is also consensus."
,"Wait, what? I don't think we spent billions on developing climate models. 

Science is a ongoing process. Models - all models - make approximations. It's how you get Newton's Law of Gravity or the Ideal Gas Law; these are also just approximations. We work on improving the approximations over time, so that we can get more accurate results when we need them, but we also still use the faster approximations when we don't need the extra accuracy. (Engineers still use Hooke's Law of Elasticity and Newton's Laws of Motion)

This paper that you cited points out a way in which one approximation used in the models might be improved. It's worth looking into, and probably worth improving, but it would hardly overthrow all of climate science or fundamentally erode the importance of CO2 if we don't. It's just an extra thing to refine. 

This is pretty much how science just works. Compared to how laypeople imagine it, science is both messier under the hood and more robust. Our understanding of the universe is under constant refinement, but the core results rarely change; they often just get more accurate. 

PS - if it matters, I write scientific models for a living, and got my PhD in another hard science field, using models to do research, where we compared the simulations with experimental results to help understand what was going on."
,"See, I´m just a hard working man, living in the country with the highest energy prices in the EU, paying the highest tax rates in the EU and a government willing to risk a total black out. Up to today we payed about 700 milliarden Euro (that´s billions in the US), another 1000 to 1200 Euro yet to come. Science got some crumbs from this giant cake, thats why there has to be ""fixed"" something.

If we had this global crisis, would´t you think there would be much more effort to get the models running? I don´t see any politician panicking (expect the Greens, thats their model)."

,"> [This](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/03/1/l_031_01.html) sudden expansion of species diversity into new ways of life is known as adaptive radiation. One way it occurs is in response to events that free up previously occupied environmental zones and roles, making way for many new species that adapt to these vacant living spaces. The extinction of the dinosaurs was one such major event, eliminating a once-dominant group of competitors while some mammals survived. But the mammals did not simply step into ecological roles vacated by the dinosaurs. It took several million years for the mammals to evolve even moderately large body sizes, and the world they inherited was a different place from the one the dinosaurs had dominated. There were new environmental habitats and new food resources to exploit. By the end of the Cretaceous, flowering plants had become dominant, providing food for burgeoning populations of insects, which in turn became another high-quality food source for the mammals, along with fruits and berries. New kinds of forests appeared, offering novel habitats for what would become tree-dwelling mammals -- primates, which first appeared about 50 million years ago, and eventually, some 45 million years later, upright-walking hominids, including us.

Why don't you tell the dinosaurs that environmental change is good for you. Or why don't you compare the expansion of mammals over 10 million years with the climate changes that occur over hundreds of years now.

Weakening of that field would *reduce* the amount of heating, exactly the opposite of your claim. The amount of auroral heating on Earth is negligible in comparison to the sources and sinks on the planet.

However, this new observational result suggests that such trapping is not occurring, and that the westward winds may be relatively weaker than expected compared with equatorward winds."

Yea, exactly like I said. The paper talks about the lack of spreading of the energy from the poles due to the winds."
,"Uh, they're talking about the models there. 

/facepalm"
,"Yes, they are. And specify that the temperature gradient shows the magnitude of the heating. This gradient is steeper than it would be without the high winds. The main question answered by the paper is to which extent the winds slow the spread of heat.

Edit: But what's an even bigger point is that even the paper points out that it's Jupiter's magnetic field which heats the poles, so a reduced magnetic field would reduce the heating, not increase it like you claim."
,They go on to say that the observations don't match the models...
,And how does a magnetic field heat the poles?
,"No, they go on to say that one model recreates the observations, but the exact mechanism of transport is unclear. Each of the models give a different magnitude of the gradient depending on different assumptions."
,"I just told you:

>Processes that couple the magnetosphere to the atmosphere give rise to intense auroral emissions and enormous deposition of energy in the magnetic polar regions...

In other words, the magnetic fields funnel the solar wind directly into the poles, dumping a lot of heat into the atmosphere in the process.

Edit: Another process is the motion of the magnetic field due to pressure from the charged particles, inducing Joule heating into the atmosphere. Again, the stronger the field, the stronger the Joule heating."

Historically, droughts and floods were the most fatal disaster events. Deaths from these events are now very low – the most deadly events today tend to be earthquakes.

India only G20 nation on track to meet Paris pact’s 2°C goal,
,"There are a couple of minor(?) imprecise claims made by this article:

>\[Times of India\] India is the only country among G20 nations which is on track to meet **what it had promised** in 2015 under the Paris Agreement on climate change unlike the top three emitters — China, the US, and the EU.

This is somewhat misleading. There is an important distinction between whether a country is on track to meet its own ""promises"" (e.g., their NDCs), and whether their NDCs are compatible with the 1.5°C or 2°C goal. According to Climate Action Tracker (their cited source on Paris Agreement compatibility):

China is on track to meet its NDC:

>\[CAT\] **China is expected to achieve its 2020 pledge and 2030 NDC targets.** Out of the three NDC targets, emissions expected from the carbon intensity target (emissions/GDP) have also been revised downward by -3 to -8% to 14.1-16.9 GtCO2e/ in 2030 due to new GDP projections in the ongoing global pandemic.

The US is not likely on track to meet its NDC, but it might:

>\[CAT\] The US has initiated the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and, after November 4 2020, will no longer be bound by its NDC. As a result of the pandemic, the CAT estimates that under current policies, the USA may have been able to reach the lower bound of its (already weak) 2025 NDC, i.e. 26% reduction target. The US is very likely to achieve its 2020 targets

The EU is on track to meet its NDC if it follows the lower-bound of CAT projections, and not on track if it follows the upper bound. See EU [country summary.](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu/)

The issue isn't so much that the top three emitters aren't meeting their own goals (NDCs), so much so that their goals themselves are either insufficient or highly insufficient in meeting both the 2°C and 1.5°C global target, as well as the current policy projections. But it's not true that India is the only G20 nation on track to meet its promise (NDCs).

>\[Times of India\]  \[the report\] showed that the other 19 leading and emerging economies were far from achieving **their goals**.

Again, this is misleading statement which makes it sound like the G20 aren't even on track to meet their own NDCs. This is largely inaccurate, rather, *the NDCs themselves* are not sufficient to limit warming to 2°C and 1.5°C. The Times are mistakenly conflating meeting NDCs with meeting the overall temperature goals.

>\[Times of India\] Of course, India is not on track for a 1.5-degree Celsius pathway - a target which gained momentum only in 2018...

This is mostly inaccurate. The Paris Agreement set the 1.5°C target in 2015. This was a strengthening of the 2°C goal set forth in the Copenhagen Accord in 2009 and the Cancun Agreements in 2010. To say that the 1.5°C target only gained momentum in 2018 ignores the emphasis placed on the 1.5°C target in the original Paris Agreement.

It should be noted that despite the inaccuracies, the core headline claim is correct. India is the only G20 country that is on track to achieve an NDC which is rated 2°C compatible by CAT."
,"I spoke on this in the South of 2 Degrees podcast several weeks ago. [South of 2 Degrees](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/south-of-2-degrees/id1510764315).

In 2017 China ranked no. 1 in CO₂ emissions at 9.8Gt yr ⁻ ¹, the US in the number 2 slot at 5.3Gt yr ⁻ ¹ and India in 3rd producing 2.5Gt yr ⁻ ¹. Now in 2018 - the capacity for power generation in India amounted to 344 GW of which coal accounted for 197 GW (57%), hydro 49.8 GW (14%), wind 34.0 GW (10%), gas 24.9 GW (7%), and solar 21.7 GW (6%) with the balance represented by a combination of biomass 8.8 GW (3%) and nuclear 6.8 GW (2%). Further, coal is estimated under the current trajectory to still supply upwards of 50% of the country’s energy needs (which are forecasted to quadruple) by 2047.

A think tank for the Indian government set a target of renewable capacity at 175GW with 160GW of which would come from solar and or wind by 2022. This coupled with expected growth would make India’s energy mix above it’s 40% renewables target under the terms of the Paris Agreement. Further, this would reduce their global emissions by 11%. 

So the real question is can India be more aggressive & what is the right balance. While my opinion is irrelevant, the latest research estimates that India - if they wanted to be truly aggressive - could economically move towards an 80% renewable energy mix.



As for the Paris Accord, you have to be careful as every country sets it’s own targets (NDC’s or Nationally Determined Contributions). You can look up every country’s commitment here: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/All.aspx"

It doesn't. Which is why that is not what the report is claiming. For gauging compatibility with the Paris Agreement The Climate Transparency Report 2020 cites Climate Action Tracker (CAT) for their assessment. Of the G20 countries, only India was rated 2°C compatible. This does not mean India alone will meet the goal, rather,

>The “2°C compatible” rating indicates that India’s climate commitment in 2030 is within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of global effort but is not consistent with the Paris Agreement. This approach requires other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow India’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C

> The study, published Wednesday in Nature, has three main findings: 

- It verifies that the main drivers of climate change since the last ice age are rising greenhouse gas concentrations and the retreat of the ice sheets.
- It suggests a general warming trend over the last 10,000 years, settling a decade-long debate the paleoclimatology community about whether this period trended warmer or cooler.
- The magnitude and rate warming over the last 150 years far surpasses the magnitude and rate of changes over the last 24,000 years.

>”This reconstruction suggests that current temperatures are unprecedented in 24,000 years, and also suggests that the speed of human-caused global warming is faster than anything we've seen in that same time,"" said Jessica Tierney, a UArizona geosciences associate professor and co-author of the study."

Ah, right, you haven’t given any. But here’s your chance! Care to present some evidence for your claim that the current warming is slow?

The previous poster correctly tells you what the geologist missed. Using polynomial fits to a trendline will introduce artifacts. The geologist messed up pretty bad there. I won't speculate about why (like, if he's retired or just rusty with the math), but that paper wouldn't pass a good college math class, much less peer review. 

Ok, so here's what's going on. 

(... i typed this whole thing out, and then realized I don't know how to explain it in a way that won't make people's eyes glaze over)

Uhhh, the long and the short of it is that when you perform a statistical trend line fit, your choice of fitting function carries *your own* assumptions into it. By picking the 6th-order function he did, he did indeed create fake artifacts when calculating the derivative. Those downturns in his green lines aren't really in the data itself, they result from his choice of mathematical model.

There are many, many others ways he could have fit a trend line to this data that wouldn't have created these statistical artifacts. Loess smoothing or running averages or just a simple linear fit all would have been *much* better, and they're standard in the science and engineering fields for good reason. This is the kind of stuff you learn in a college probability class, what tools to use and how you can mess up by picking the wrong tool. 

To see the 2nd derivative, he'd have done better to do a simple 2-step or 3-step finite difference on any of the smoothed trends.

Yeah, this is just bad work. It's mathturbation; the kind of abuse of statistics that lead to that quip about lies and damned lies. 

Source: I've got an undergraduate degree in math, a PhD in a math-heavy hard science field, worked at a national lab, and write scientific models for a living. 

I can give you the more detailed explanation if you want, but I didn't want to throw it at you without warning.

One possibility that is not discussed is the use of BECCS. Using Biomass Energy production with Carbon Capture and Sequestering. BECCS may be a good way to remove at least some carbon from the atmosphere. But side effects may be prohibitive. Loss of biodiversity, CO2 emissions from change in land use."

However, large scale biomass extraction may indeed cause loss of biodiversity and at least temporarily (on the scale of decades) extra emissions. Also extra CO2 emissions from changed land use is a possibility.

"Climate crisis reducing land’s ability to sustain humanity, says IPCC | Environment",
,Why is this not on the frontpage??
,This is more than alarming. What kind of choice is this ? Feeding people or fighting climate in the near future if we don't do it now by changing our food production.
,"This is old news. At least five years ago Col. Larry Wilkerson, Colin Powell's chief of staff, gave a talk in Houston in which he said that the Pentagon was being told that in the worst case scenario there would only be enough arable land on the planet for four hundred million people. He asked ""Where do you bury eight billion people""."
,"I wonder why the guardian article didn’t also note this observation from the very same IPCC report?

IPCC: *Globally, vegetation greening has occurred over a larger area than vegetation browning (high confidence)*...[due to] CO2 fertilisation

If there’s more green stuff on the planet, can’t we assume there’ll be more salads to eat?

Edit: added the co2 fertilisation part. 

Note: downvotes I’ll assume mean one thinks: “global greening is a bad thing”

since IPCC reports typically share only bad news."
,Didn’t ehrlich have the same prediction in 1979?
,"What percentage of humanity starved to death in the  last, oh, 30 years compared with any 30 year period 200 years ago?"
,CO2 helps plants. Tony Heller keeps showing there are far fewer fires than before man showed up. And more droughts? When has the IPCC ever been right? They predicted that last year for the USA and it turned out to be one of the top three wettest winters in recorded history.

,"> Further heating will lead to unprecedented climate conditions at lower latitudes, with potential growth in hunger, migration and conflict and increased damage to the great northern forests. 

Okay, the thing is, this is bullshit.  We produce way, WAY more food now per acre than anytime in human history. We'll continue to produce more food per acre than anytime in the 20th century, the 19th century, etc. for the foreseeable future.   ""Climate Change will increase hunger...""  Growing populations increase hunger, but no one is calling for a drop in population. Why is that?  Oh, everyone will die, hunger will increase, starvation will occur but adding another 20% to the mouths we have to feed is fine - can't call for a reduction in growth rate that is not politically correct!

We are poisoning our land with pesticides (80% reduction in insects that feed on croplands in the US since we started spraying the fields liberally with pesticides) but a few tenths of a degree of warming is what we should really be talking about!   Everything that feeds on insects, like birds and bats, suffer from a lack of the food source.  But we should really be talking about temperature!

We are building things in places that were wild just a couple of generations ago, denying nature the use of it.  But, nope, we should panic over the idea that in the future, our food supply, that has [""more than doubled in the last 40 years""](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmenvfru/213/21301.gif) and has grown faster than the population, might suddenly start to drop back. 

Besides, I like oranges, too."
,"What type of expertise is needed to look at historical climate logs and then point them out to everybody that has an open mind. Just because he loves making fools out of climate alarmists with the facts doesn't make him a ""false expert""."
,"> Climate change wont make 2 fucks of a difference

I rather trust scientific reports on that issue over reddit comments, but thanks for your opinion."
,"There is not a simple answer.

The previous argument only makes sense if we exclude the possibility of a crash. Only then it makes sense to assume that the future will be similar to our past, that we can extrapolate previous experiences into the future.

However, science is warning us about a ""crash"", about tipping points which can be crossed, that the changes can gain momentum, they used the word ""unprecedented"".

It seems uninformed to assume a steady, continuous development. But if you want to do so, you should be able to show that this steady motion can be expected. Which of course is impossible, we know about tipping points."
,So in short you believe the climate crisis is a hoax?
,"While I didn't believe Colin Powell about ""weapons of mass destruction"", I will take what scientists are telling him over your opinion. But I absolutely understand if you can't handle the truth. And many of the same people who are worried about temperature ARE worried about pesticides and over population. Many of those LeFtiSt iNtELLeCtUaLs can worry about more than one thing at a time."
,"With the increased efficiency in farming, that worse case scenario above must involve the destruction of major breadbaskets and little to no adaptation to the changing climate. My understanding is the status quo isn’t on the worse case scenario - RCP8.5 - but even a billion people starving from loss of farmland would be an unprecedented crisis in modern history."
,"He misrepresents research and cherry-picks data, and **he draws conclusions that fly directly in the face of the research that he cites.**

So, he's a false expert and a liar and you are wrong."
," If you accept that in the past we have had significant variations to our climate caused by both short term and long term extreme events, such as volcanic and tectonic action, ice ages, non ice ages, meteor collisions (crashes) then anything unprecedented would, or will be, catastrophic.  

Is this what you mean by a tipping point and will it be driven by human CO2 emissions."
,"Not at all. Since when did all scientific fields of study have to be defined as binary choices?  Food is either ""nutritious or has zero value,"" medicine either cures you or does nothing, climate change is either going to doom the world or it is a complete hoax?

Have a little room in your world for nuance. Climate Change is real - the world does not have the exact same climate as in 1729.  See, I believe in climate change.  We have warmed.  The actions of humans have affected the climate - caused some warming, maybe even all of the warming.  I'm not convinced that the science shows that humans are 100% the cause.  There seems to be some people are making that claim, while others do not. 

Will increased warming cause more drought?  In some regions, yes. In other regions, no.  Will we have to shift where some of our food is grown? Yes, most likely.  Will billions die of starvation because of claimate change in the next 50 years?  I honestly don't believe that will be the case.

Or, we could look at it this way, even if climate change didn't exist, if we continue to grow in population without figuring out how to grow a LOT more food, we will eventually get to the point where people are starving because we're not able to grow enough.  Is that the cause of extra CO2 in the air?  I'm thinking that is a factor, but not the MAIN factor.  If you need to blame ONLY ONE FACTOR for every thing that is wrong with the world, you're going to miss out on a lot of what is wrong in the world.

So, can we feed 7.5 billion people today? Yep.  Could we feed 7.5 billion people in 20 years time?  Yes, we could.  Can we feed 10 billion people in 20 years time? Not with our current crop yields.  We will have to figure out how to produce enough food over what we're producing now to cover another 2.5 billion mouths. 

If we have more severe droughts than we do today, that could be a factor. But, as I said, it isn't clear that we should be growing food **where there are severe droughts**.  Or, using the same techniques and poisons that we're using to grow food today."
,">I will take what scientists are telling him over your opinion.

Be my guest. So, what do you think will be the year of the food tipping point?  Next year?  2030?  Will famine wipe out 50% of the world's population before 2040? 

>I absolutely understand if you can't handle the truth.

Ah, I see. You know **the truth** and I just can't handle it?  And is ""the truth"" that we're a couple of decades from global collapse?  I need to know, so I can plan for the future.  Should I build a bunker now, or can I wait a couple of years?"
,"> even a billion people starving from loss of farmland would be an unprecedented crisis in modern history.

Yes, it would."
,"Care to give specifics or are you going to remain a little kid and insist the equivalent of girls are yucky and also have cooties? You need to open your eyes, watch a few of his videos, compare them to the IPCC, and get perspective. https://youtu.be/J7oxn7z72Q0"
,"From Hans Rosling's book: Factfulness, Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--- and Why Things are Better Than You Think:

I pointed out that the idea of a food crisis had a LOT more factors than temperature, that we've more than doubled our capacity to provide food in the last 50 or 60 years, and that projections of us not being able to feed everyone because of **climate change** tends to ignore or dismiss the other factors as if they don't matter.  

Yes, I know people can be concerned about more than one thing. But, when one wants to talk about food scarcity, it might be important to not focus on one of many factors, and that factor might not even be the most impactful one.  Doing so is intellectually dishonest.

Your reply that I ""can't handle the truth"" did not do anything to further the conversation, refute my point, or get us closer to food security.  It was pure insult."
,Funny how this crap gets an upvote
,"Yeah, it's a fascinating phenomenon to watch. I thinks it's best understood from a cultural evolutionary psychology perspective.  Apocalypse narratives have a long genealogy; humans have always been vulnerable to natural catastrophes--- famine, plagues, pestilence, floods. So you get these archetypal cultural reactions--- a visceral embrace of the worst case, castigating non-believers, admonitions to perform sacrifices, etc. You have climates scientists like Stefan Rahmstorf making obeisance to Greta Thunberg over at realclimate.  There's even a horseman of the climate apocalypse, the Tipping Point."
Scientists can now grow wood in a lab without cutting a single tree,
,"This is a potentially neat technology, but this article seems to believe that the main cause of deforestation is needing lumber for furniture.

That is absolutely not the case.

Modern lumber industries are already super sustainable, to my knowledge; On a trip to Alaska, a guide talked about how they have sections of the forest scheduled to be cut down and re-planted in intervals to ensure a steady supply of wood.

The main cause of deforestation is clearing land to build things on it, especially for agricultural use."
,"You could grow wood in interesting ways and potentially more efficiently than photosynthesis, which in the grand scheme of solar energy capturing methods is pretty ineffecient"
,"I grow and harvest wood in my forest, without causing any deforestation.

I am not even able to harvest trees as fast as the forest grows. Or as fast as young trees replace the ones I harvested. So sometimes I just cut down ""bad"" trees. Trees that grow too close to another, is damaged or crooked. And let them rot in place. I increase biodiversity and variety over time and also increase the sequestering of carbon in the soil. People are free to pick mushrooms and berries as they please. Or just roam and enjoy the forest and the birds and other fauna. I make some money from hunters for the right to hunt in my forest. I sell some timber. I also saw my own lumber for carpentry and building, and heat my home with wood.

That article doesn't make sense."

I'm not sure what you are trying to say exactly. You are not producing wood on a large scale...

Commercial timber ops are expensive and require a lot of land. If factory produced wood is cleaner and cheaper than real forestry, then it's a valuable advance. We need more wild land.

,"Thinking very long term, won’t not cutting down trees greatly offset the carbon footprint of growing wood, since trees soak up the carbon?"

,"We cut down on the cycle, which could soak up more if treated better. But only by taking wood out of the cycle we get net negative. In some distant utopia we may conserve wood to store carbon, like coal in the ground is just conserved wood.
But that's a tad ridiculous as we should cut down emissions first"
,"When trees eventually die, rot or are burnt, the carbon they stored is released again. So a mature forest does not help a lot with sequestering carbon in the wood.

It is possible to make the soil sequester more and more carbon over time. Grow thicker and thicker. Typically you do this by encouraging biodiversity and avoid to large disturbances. And by allowing dead wood to rot. 

Clear-cutting large areas may cause the soil to instead degrade and emit carbon in the form of methane and CO2. 

It is similar to regenerative farming avoiding frequent tilling and plowing and using plants with deep and large root systems that remain in the soil after harvesting.

But soil sequestering like this is slower than the uptake of CO2 in the growing trees and crops."
,"Thinking very long-term it won't cause the trees will also die one day and yes, they do make the soil more carbon rich than the soil a desert is (for example) but this is not infinite. The ecosystems reach equilibrium (or nearly) after some time, thus planting more and more trees isn't a solution per se."

,"I wonder what the effect will be on[ carbon emissions through enteric fermentation, because that makes up about 39% of cattle's overall emissions, with 45% of their carbon emissions coming from their land clearing,food production in general and food transportation](https://academic.oup.com/af/article/9/1/69/5173494). Would shipping seaweed all over the world to feed cows potentially cause an uptick in carbon emissions, and how would that compare to the reduction of methane at least as far as their quantitative negative effects on the environment. I can't help but wonder if the overall balance will actually be better since [carbon lasts longer in the atmosphere than methane](http://www.planetexperts.com/greenhouse-gas-worse-methane-carbon-dioxide/) and is causing [ocean acidification that is helping to drive this latest mass extinction](https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/09/21/why-we-could-trigger-mass-extinction-in-the-ocean-within-decades), [as well as previous ones](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/230006/20180612/too-much-carbon-dioxide-caused-mass-extinction-of-ocean-organisms-182-million-years-ago.htm).

I guess I'm also wondering if the seaweed will have any effects on the other waste products of cows, like the [ammonia that causes health problems like asthma for people living near farms](https://ensia.com/features/ammonia/), or the nitrogen that causes soil, air, and [water pollution that also causes serious rural health issues like blue baby syndrome](https://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2015/11/nitrate-in-water-widespread-current-rules-no-match-for-it/)."

>carbon lasts longer in the atmosphere than methane

While it is always good to question the over all impact of new research, simply throwing out questions in order to throw doubt without putting in any effort is problematic.

When we calculated the CO2e of a gas, its lifetime radiatve forcing as the original gas then as CO2 over 100 years is taken into account.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon\_dioxide\_equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_equivalent)

This is the basics of the field known to people who know the difference between ""carbon"" and carbon dioxide.

There is a not so subtle difference between curiosity and truculence. Such as simply not reading the article

> Methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas: During its 12-year lifespan after being released, it traps 84 times as much heat as carbon dioxide, and its effect on global warming over a century is 34 times that of CO2."
,Wow! Good thoughts!
,"**Carbon dioxide equivalent**

Carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) and equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2e and CO2eq) are two related but distinct measures for describing how much global warming a given type and amount of greenhouse gas may cause, using the functionally equivalent amount or concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the reference.

Several popular YouTube creators have joined together with Arbor Day Foundation to plant 20 million trees by January 1 2020.,
,I've got 20 acres of old field.  I'd be happy to fill it with trees if anyone wants to help me pay for them.
,I actually appreciate the thought but don't we need something around 200 Billion trees to actually have a serious impact on climate change? And they need to be planted quickly so they can grow in time...
,Hopefully this brings some issues and fundraising to a bigger mainstream audience.
,How much do you estimate something like that would cost?
,"Just to give an idea of the scope of this planting and the area it may require, Finland claim they have 10 trees for everyone on the planet. ie 70 billion."
,"Many billions to see a substantial effect. 1 trillion to curb approx 1/3 of warming. Of course don’t forget the small picture, giving animals places to live and reproduce helps preserve their numbers. Habitat destruction is very serious"
,"There are too many factors to throw out a number with any ease, especially since I am not a forester.  But I do know it depends on what species of trees, what density of planting and what size of saplings.  If I was to only plant the conifers that are cheapest and most readily available as whips, I could probably plant the entire 20 acres for a little less than $2000.  However, My goal would be to plant a mix of native species that would provide habitat for a variety of wildlife.  Depending on how much money I had at my disposal I would have larger or smaller plantings of native fruits with corresponding larger or smaller clearings and a wider variety of large timber species.  The native fruit species are significantly more expensive.  I would expect them to cost ten or 15 times more per acre, but I'm not sure if they are planted at the same density as the timber species.  It is harder to find information about them.  I hope to get some help from the USDA next summer and make a concrete plan.

[here](https://imgur.com/a/DLisHeR) are a few pictures of me and some of the trees/shrubs I have tested on my land.  you can see there is a lot of open space where more trees could go."
,"I'll be honest, I don't have a scientific or Forrester background so I can't offer any advice on that front. Maybe, someone from Reddit has more expertise and can opine?

I would definitely be interested in helping fund local afforestation projects like that. Have you considered putting it on a crowd funding website or something."
,"I have.  I've had a couple of conversations at r/permaculture with people who have also suggested a crowd funding appeal.  I have no idea how to do such a thing, but since several people have suggested that they would be interested in supporting such a project, I think I should.  However, my first step is to get some support from someone who can give me more technical assistance.  I actually did have the local USDA forester come visit my property when I first purchased it 13 years ago, but they were not giving grants to improve properties so small.  They did tell me a few things about how to manage the 10 or so acres that are forested, but there wasn't any money to help me plant.  At the time I had different ideas of what I wanted and was more interested in exotic species, where as now I'd be more interested in planting native varieties.  I still would like to plant a section of improved cultivars as a commercial orchard (apples, pears, cherries and the like) but that would be a separate project."

Why is this?

The idea that the IPCC reports might be overly conservative in its projections is still rather controversial in this sub, but this provides a basis for understanding why it might be the case"
,"> Moreover, if consensus is viewed as a requirement, scientists may avoid discussing tricky issues that engender controversy (but might still be important), or exclude certain experts whose opinions are known to be “controversial” (but may nevertheless have pertinent expertise).

,"From the book in question:

>""Elsewhere we have documented a pattern we label ""erring on the side of least drama."" By this we mean that scientists often have a tendency to avoid dramatic findings, because drama is associated with emotion, feelings, irrationality, and even femininity, qualities that have traditionally been viewed as at odds with scientific rationality. We have shown that in several domains related to climate change, scientists' estimates of various threats - CO2 emissions, Arctic Sea ice loss, Sea level rise - have tended to be low relative to actual outcomes. Scientists considered such underestimates to be ""conservative"" because they are conservative with respect to the question of when to sound an alarm or how loudly to sound it. (It is of course not conservative when viewed in terms of giving people adequate time to prepare.) The history recounted here is consistent with this finding: That WAIS assessments underestimated the threat of rapid ice sheet disintegration, because most of the scientists who participated were more comfortable with an estimate that they viewed as ""Conservative"" than with one that was not.""

The authors examined the history of the ""Acid Rain"" and ""Ozone"" issues as well, and found similar ""path of least drama"" biases."
,"Is it possible that the peer review process itself has a conservative bias? That is effectively what the book is arguing.

In the UK we have two parallel legal processes - in the criminal justice system, proof is required ""beyond reasonable doubt"", while in the civil legal system, a lower threshold is required, the ""balance of probability"" 

The high level of consensus required by the ipcc makes it more similar to the criminal justice system - it is extremely reliable (at least this much is certain) and therefore inevitable conservative, because what is likely, but unproven, is excluded.

Obviously the whole area is massively complex, and also politicised, which makes all judgements difficult, but there is very clearly a trend in my observation for significant milestones to ground rush ahead of the most respected scientific opinion. 

Any scientist predicting current arctic phenomena 20 years ago would have been considered alarmist and extreme - and given the required level of certainty at the time, this would have been fair enough.... And yet, here we are!

Insisting that only what has been proven beyond reasonable doubt is possible seems to be a failed strategy. The entire field is much more uncertain than we would like.

A global effort to remove 1 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to enrich our agricultural soils,
,"Seems like a cool initiative! 

I'd like to know where they get the 1 trillion metric tons goal from though? 

the IPCC SR1.5 has this to say about soil sequestration:

>At local scales there is robust evidence that Soil Carbon Sequestration (SCS, e.g.,agroforestry,De Stefano and Jacobson,2018), restoration of degraded land (Griscom et al., 2017), or conservation agriculture management practices (Aguilera et al., 2013; Poeplau and Don, 2015; Vicente-Vicente et al., 2016)have co-benefits in agriculture and that many measures are cost-effective even without supportive climate policy. 

Ok, good stuff, seem to be in line so far, now lets look at numbers.

>Evidence at global scale for potentials and especially costs is much lower.

...

>The literature spans cost ranges of –40–100 USDtCO2-1(negative costs relating to the multiple co-benefits of SCS, such as increased productivity and resilience of soils (P. Smith et al., 2014)and 2050 potentials are estimated between 1–11 GtCO2 yr-1, narrowed down to **2–5 GtCO2yr-1** considering that studies above 5 GtCO2 yr-1 often do not apply constraints, while estimates lower than 2 GtCO2yr-1 mostly focus on single practices (Fuss et al., 2018).

Ok, so sequestration possibility of 2-5GtCO2yr. No bad - but wouldn't that take 200-500 years to sequester 1Tt?

>SCS has negligible water and energy requirements (Smith, 2016), affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust evidence)and can be applied without changing current land use thus making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land footprint. **However, soil sinks saturate after 10–100 years, depending on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016)**.

Ouch, so ""best case"" would be ~500Gt over 100 years if all soil could sequester the maximum possible (not at all probable). Taking a mid range of  3.5Gt/yr and saturation period of 50 years gives us only.... 175GtCO2 sequestered. 

In addition, we need to consider the large amounts of fossil fuels used in agriculture - I don't have a number on this at hand, but the emissions related to fertilizer production (Haber-Bosch, phosphorous rock mining), transportation, running (and producing) the farm equipment, etc.

You also agree to pay Indigo the amount of the discrepancy, together with interest at a rate equivalent to the short term Federal interest rate, plus three percent (3%), within thirty (30) days of receiving the audit results. 

Don't get me wrong, this seems like an awesome initiative that could be greatly beneficial to both food production, agriculture related environmental issues, and carbon sequestration in general. I really do support the ideas and ideology that they espouse - however, their claims of 1Tt of sequestration raises a huge red flag for me, in addition to their extensive products and services."
,They have an abstract website and obscure solutions.  They sure do have a definite concrete number though.
,"Simplest, lowest cost, presently available solution."
,"Lots of great comments.  Made me go back to basic math.
3.6 billion acres.
Assume we can achieve 3% in top 1foot of top soil.
1 foot of top soil will weighat least  50 lbs.  Assume 40,000sq feet per acre, thats 2 M lbs/A
If 3% is carbon, thats 60,000 lbs or 30 tons carbon/A.
30x 3.6 billion is 108 billion.

That is about .1 Terraton
So to get to  1 terraton you have to assume 10 feet deep at 3%.  

Yeah, some very few roots of cultivated plants go that deep (egHops go 20) but most dont.

So I agree indigo's numbers dont add up.

It is still a great idea and reduces reliance on petro fertilizers.  

So farmers, dont subscribe to indigo, just do it."
,"I have never heard that plants feed sugars back into the soil from their roots. Plant roots grow in soil and eventually die and decompose back into the soil but l am skeptical that it is a living process. 

I’m not sure either if carbon is taken up by roots yet l am certain that carbon dioxide is absorbed by leaves from the atmosphere where it chemically reacts with water absorbed by the roots from the soil to produce sugar. 

From.   
https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/where_do_trees_get_their_mass_from

The mass of a tree is primarily carbon. The carbon comes from carbon dioxide used during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants convert the sun’s energy into chemical energy which is captured within the bonds of carbon molecules built from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. Yes, the carbon from carbon dioxide in the air we breathe out ends up in “food” molecules (called glucose) each of which contains 6 carbon atoms (and 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms).

I think the benefit of adding forms of carbon to the soil is that it improves aeration and water retention. This provides a better environment for soil organisms. ie. symbolic bacteria that can covert  atmospheric NO2 directly from air in the soil to NO3 that is taken up from the soil by the plant through the roots. 

This article seems to me to be plea for investment. Anyone who is happy to accept these claims should be willing to invest in this scheme with their own money."

,"Solid analysis - didn’t read it, but did they mention biochar?"
,The IPCC or IndigoAg?
,IndigoAG
,"They don't specifically mention Biochar, however, [Indigo Carbon](https://www.indigoag.com/for-growers/indigo-carbon) seems to be  product that farmers can buy from IndigoAG for their soil. The stated benefits are quite close to my understanding of biochar, so most likely it's a form of biochar or similar.

Edit: And the natural progression would be ""How much would biochar add to soil sequestration"". The answer is... not much:

>Fuss et al. (2018)lower the 2050 range to **0.3–2 GtCO2 yr-1**. This potential is below previous estimates (e.g.,Woolf et al.,2010), which additionally consider the displacement of fossil fuels through biochar. Permanence depends on soil type and biochar production temperatures, varying between a few decades and several centuries (Fang et al., 2014). Costs are 30–120 USD tCO2–1(medium agreement, medium evidence) (McCarl et al., 2009; McGlashan et al., 2012; McLaren, 2012; Smith, 2016).

>However, 40–260 Mha are needed to grow the biomass for biochar for implementation at 0.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1(Smith, 2016), even though it is also possible to use residues (e.g., Windeatt et al.,2014). Biochar is further constrained by the maximum safe holding capacity of soils (Lenton, 2010)and the labile nature of carbon sequestrated in plants and soil at higher temperatures (Wang et al., 2013).

So, over our previously considered 50 yer estimate, Biochar could add a middle estimate of 1.1GtCO2/yr for a total of 55GtCo2 at a land-cost of ~5Bha of land devoted *only* to biochar creation. 

To put that in context, the USA only has ~ [174.5Mha](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Agriculture/Arable-land/Hectares) of arable land. According to [""Our World in Data""](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture) to total global agricultural land area is 4,889 million ha or 4.8Bha and total global land area is ~13Bha . This would mean that, based on the IPCC numbers, it would take 38% of our total global land area (and more than our total current agricultural land area) to produce biomass for biochar - to sequester *only* 1.1GtCO2/yr. This, when one of the primary suggestions by the IPCC is to *decrease* total land-under-agriculture by 25%+ by 2050 in order to facilitate aforestation and reforestation (which are estimated to capture and sequester more CO2/yr than biochar anyways). This does not seem like either a realistic option (logistics alone), not an optimal option for carbon capture and sequestration.  Most likely, biochar will only function to increase agricultural output and assist in creating long-term, sustainable, healthy soil - but will play little to no roll in carbon capture and sequestration."
,"ah cool, thanks! Yeah, seems like they would be involved in something biochar related ... it feels like it's fallen out of a favor a bit in the past few years, but it still feels like there's a ton of potential with biochar. In case you're interested, this recent podcast ep had a really good overview of its potential: https://nori.com/podcasts/reversing-climate-change/79-biochar-or-using-fire-to-cool-the-earthwith-albert-bates"
,"Hey, thanks for the cool podcast recommendation! Also, see my edit around the potential of biochar as far as the *IPCC* numbers go."
,">\~5Bha of land devoted  only  to biochar creation.

&#x200B;

Nice, thanks for this – only point I'd make is biochar creation doesn't necessarily need land - it just needs a facility to essentially 'char' whatever material you want to use. That podcast I linked to has a lot of good insight into this -- I loved his idea of using the excess seaweed that hits the beaches (becoming a bigger problem in certain parts of the world) and turning that into bio-char. 

&#x200B;

There's just lots of interesting applications of it – one other I liked is that it speeds up growth for plants/tree's ... so i.e. if you planted tree's and they need 10 years to get to maturity so that they could be capturing the fully estimated amount of c02, adding biochar into the soil would speed up that process by double."
,"Oh yeah, biochar has some great applications, I agree! Terra Preta in the amazon is pretty amazing as well. 

The point is that there's no real way to scale-up biochar to make any meaningful difference as far as carbon capture and sequestration goes - not that there aren't other benefits to it."

Your parents went through 9/11, multiple devastating recessions, etc., and *their* parents went through AIDS, the Ozone crisis, etc., and *their* parents went through Vietnam, Love Canal, violent civil rights battles, and that's only halfway through the last century. 

As the Covid crisis reminded us, the world routinely goes through horrific plagues and pandemics. Just a century ago, as World War I was still killing its tens of millions worldwide (when the population was only 1.6 billion), a flu pandemic killed \~50 million people. Routinely, volcano eruptions have darkened the skies for *years* and caused massive famines and starvation, most recently in 1815: [https://courses.bowdoin.edu/history-2203-fall-2020-sboe/your-choosing-i/](https://courses.bowdoin.edu/history-2203-fall-2020-sboe/your-choosing-i/) )

There's *always* something bad going on, always some global crisis. One thing that's different now is we have more ability to limit damage -- while also having more ability to *cause* damage, such as nuclear weapons and burning carbon for industrial society -- so pandemics kill far fewer people, and many new methods are becoming available to lessen and eventually reverse climate change.

If you're passionate about climate change, there are hundreds of interesting and meaningful careers you could have as an adult. Meanwhile, remember that millennials (probably your parents) are an especially gloomy, stressed-out generation. They make everything sound worse than it is, and they are the first generation to have their minds destroyed by late-capitalism social media. You'll probably do much better!

And you will probably have a ""normal"" life, if you mean having work, family, education, etc."

,"Hi! As someone else said, there's no such thing as normal. But, the thing that our previous generations lacked was probably the amount of responsibility and burden placed on the next generation to ""unfuck things"". I mean, yes, a hundred years ago (and well, actually, it's still going on in undeveloped countries), children worked from the age of 2 or 3. However I don't think they were expected to build their worldview of the future or involve themselves in policy as much as young people do now to avoid natural catastrophes.

I'm not going to lie. The next few decades are going to be a bit harsh. I'm only around 15 years older than you and sometimes I am scared. It is normal to be scared given everything that's happening and since we're at a crossroad. But, if there is anything consoling is that we are not alone in climate change, nor are we alone at facing it. There is still some remnant people trying to make money from avoiding the inevitable: that we are undergoing massive changes in our society. It starts slow and then it will be all at once. From EV cars, hopefully more bike-friendly cities, to renewables everywhere to hopefully re-greening our cities and landscapes and consuming much less disposable stuff than we've been using up the past 40 years.

Changes are hard to make and live through, specially when they're made during a crisis. But crisis are great accelerators for change. Some are going to point out that the crisis is due to the necessary changes, but most people are not so easily fooled, we know we're running out of time to flip the switch.

I often have high hope for the future. It is going to suck sometimes in the meantime, but if we push the strings in the right direction - and, with how the climate crisis is built things are meant to go mostly in the right way - then even through the bad times there is a lot of things to enjoy and a lot of things to look forward to. As well as spending time with family and friends.

I remember how, when I was a kid, my parents used to tell me how this and that place used to be a grassfield or how much less urbanized and beautiful X was. In some places, we are going to have to revert urban spread/suburbs and return land back to nature. We are re-learning what was stolen from our parent's generation: that we are not meant to live only with and for our most-inner circle. That we are stronger together as a community. That we are part of nature and the natural world and wildlife is meant to surround us, that we are not ""a thing apart"". That we shouldn't feel alone, looking to the stars for ""life outside earth"", when we are so surrounded by different animal lifetimes and ways of understanding, by this incredibly complex and beautiful system...

We are going to go through a change as big as the Industrial Revolution, but ""in reverse"" in some ways. At that time, children left the countryside and moved to cities, where the air was more polluted, but they often had a chance of an education or of learning a trade.

Nowadays, I expect many more to live in cities, but those cities will have to transform to something more sustainable. Less roads for cars, more bikes and parks and public places for gardening. We will transform green places to sustain more native birds and insects, specially in the suburbs. And when we go across the country, we will see more windmills, and solar panels everywhere, even on farmland. Some will say now that it looks ugly. But those solar panels, contaminate almost nothing compared to our power plants now. They do not pollute your air nor water. They will bring money to farmers, and keep their crops safe from extreme weather. They also are more water efficient for the crops.

We're re-building things to outlive us and to solve many problems at once: to sustain and let humans thrive and to let nature thrive. And that is much more worth than all the ads our parents have grown up with, and that I have seen as normal during our whole childhoods. We are also rewilding and rebuilding ecosystems that our grandparents or great-grandparents lost through overgrazing or hunting. And now with our current experience and knowledge we know how to recover the lost forests, grasslands, etc. I'm really excited to see wild bison like we haven't seen in Europe in a century.

Get into /r/solarpunk if you're bored. We need to keep dreaming and make that happen. It is within our reach and it is what we need to do."
,"This era imo is akin to the famine of 1315 in Europe (driven by climate change) and the sociopolitical impact of the black plague combined. It's a chaotic time and nothing will be like it was. We have a lot of adapting and creating new institutions and structures and healing of the planet ahead of us. Everything will change. Hopefully for the better. 

Learn learn learn. Plan accordingly. Stay hopeful but not blind."

,Yes you can. Find the magic in everyday things.
,"I just watched a CBS morning show on Sunday and they were doing a bit on a company in Colorado that does vertical gardening. No soil, it's like a weird gelatinous nutrient / water mixture that the plants grow in. This tiny building produces 100,000 LBs of food per year. They use all LED lighting and grow indoors year round.

If you had a smaller set up like this + your own power system (solar / wind with batteries) could do quite well. The indoor growing also requires significantly less water because of the no soil / less evaporation."
,"What is normal?

I flipped through a book about the most terrible predators humans have driven to extinction. One was a huge hyena like creature. 6 feet across at the shoulders. Just this massive beast that ate people for snacks and our ancestors had to fight those with sticks and rocks. They hunted those to extinction.

I'm reading a book about homesteaders and my grandpa was quoted in it. He spent a winter living alone in a tent in -30 C weather when he was twelve because they hadn't built enough shelter yet to house him. He enjoyed it.

Past generations have had to endure a lot. You might have to as well. But your ancestors could handle it and so can you. Life is a challenge and an adventure - you get to see what you can do."
,Every generation has a different experience. I’d suggest reading Oliver Twist if you think your generation has it harder than any other.
,If you want some sense of normality and sustainability I would recommend looking in to off grid living and permaculture.  Arguably that’s been the norm for ages.  It takes a fair amount of work and education to do it right but the self empowerment and freedom will be worth it depending on how you set yourself up.  It’s worth taking an entrepreneurial path for the sake of being financially secure and self dependant.  Start saving up and learning how to do it wisely by reaching out and visiting others whose properties/lives/experiences/methods you find attractive and enticing.
,"Not sure what you consider ‘normal’. People have always had to deal with tough things. Do you think having to fight in WW2 was ‘normal’?

This time you are living in is as normal as any other time. Find ways of enjoying it rather than wishing you were living in a time that never actually existed."
,"Well a generation is about 20 years and life has only really been ""good"" after the 2nd world war so say about 80 years give or take. 4 generations. 

Before then there was mass poverty, multiple famines, rampant disease, near constant wars (this being the longest sustained ""peace time"". So you probably are on course for a normal life. Albeit a hotter and wetter one.

Now if you meant a good life, like the last 4 generations, the answer I'd say is maybe. You'll have to make it though, whether that's fair or not, you'll have to graft ro fix the problems of the past. 

Even then you might still struggle but you might give the generations after you a chance at the good life. The real question is will you do that knowing there might not be a reward for you at the end of it? Or will you just cling to the comforts and justify it as being owed because the generations before had it good and continued making things worse because your ""owed"" it. 

Would blame anyone for taking the 2nd option but I am  urious to see if this generation will break the cycle. You could be the best generation since the war generation. Or you could be just as bad butvwhine about it not being your fault and unfair while doing nothing to make it better. Only time will tell. Life's a bitch."
,"Every generation lives a different life from the one before. “Normal” is such a fluid term, what was normal 50 years ago is now uncommon, and vice versa."
,"Nothing happens twice. Your life, your generation is distinct and peculiar in its circumstances. What seems normal to you about past generations was amazing and probably unwelcome in parts. Their comfort and prosperity and lives was achieved, with compromise of a huge or a minor part of it. 
The dream is possible, @OP. I can only encourage you to have faith that you will prevail."
,"I am 40 and I've spent the last several years coming to terms that there is no such thing as a normal life. Everyone has problems more often than not. We have climate change, but before that was the cold war, cuban missile crisis, Vietnam, WW1 and 2, Spanish Flu, the Plague, etc, etc. Life is a constant mess that we have painted over to look like it's orderly."
,"When you feel like quitting just dont for one more day, I finally landed my “high end” job paying really good money 5 years ago when I started applying for it and now that I have it it’s so expensive to live where I do that I am actually going backwards instead of getting ahead, stick with us, it won’t be like this forever and we are the change we want to see. Patience my friend"
,Tune out the fear mongers.   You'll be fine.
,"Short answer: no, it isn't

Long answer: The same a generation born in Europe around 1890 (thus coming of age in WWI) or 1925 (the same for WWII) might have asked.

Generally it is impossible to re-live anything that already happened simply because the world always changes. From the relative stability of the Roman empire in 400 AD nothing remained in 500 AD. This came with an unprecedented loss of technology and civilization.

Heraclitus, a philosopher of Ancient Greece, put it this way: ""You never step into the same river twice"", meaning the water is always flowing, and the same water will never come back."
,"Wow, there are a lot of collapsers here. It's tough to predict the future and there is a chance things will get much worse, especially in certain areas. But the pessimistic view that human civilization is collapsing or that we're going back to subsistence agriculture is not the consensus. Damages will be significant and there are impacts that are difficult to estimate, but estimates of losses tend to be in single digit percentages of GDP.

,"You can have a life which is much better than all of your peers.   Maybe even better than your great-great-great-great-great grandparents.  You just have to make the right decisions.   You need to see that we are past peak prosperity, probably past peak oil, past peak copper, past peak soil, past peak clean water.   


So choose a career/profession consistent with that.  good to be close to the soil, good source of water, regenerative agriculture, minimal energy consumption, healthy life style, low dependence on medical care.  If you take such a strategy, you will do better than your peers.   


It is also important to get educated about what is happening, educate your family and friends, and get politically active.  ""It is worth fighting for every 1/10 of a degree of climate change."" said a scientist from the Potsdam climatology institute."
,"I don't know what ""normal"" means but there is a 0% it will be the same as any past historical period."
,Focus on love.  No matter what adversity or challenges you face.  Love for yourself and those you choose and you will be fulfilled.  You’re generation maybe be our saving grace if they choose grace and love over hate.
,"There is no such thing as “normal.” Each generation faces new challenges— WWI, WWII, the Great Depression, sky high interest rates in the early 1980s, the 2008 housing crash, COVID…

The best thing you can do is get a solid education, focus on a career that’s meaningful to you and attempt to make smart financial and personal decisions. The rest requires a bit of luck and persistence."
,"My dad is in his 90s, my sister and I in our 60s, and he said to us that he thought we might be the last generation who get to live a ‘normal’ life before there are significant negative changes."
,Not Unless these big companies realize that if there’s no earth there’s no money.
,"yeah, spend less time on the internet and on your phone."
,"You can absolutely live a normal life like past generations and it is fairly easy to obtain if you are dedicated. I will assume you are American. 

First you have to prioritize your earnings. If you can ensure you have a middle class income, you should have no issues living a normal life. There's many career paths for this so you have options. 

Next you need to control your spending. Focus on avoiding the unnecessary excesses that are sold to you today. People in the 1950s did not (and could not) constantly pay to have food delivered, vacations were cheap and local, houses were smaller, car loans were an average of 36 months. You can have the life of previous generations only if you actually are willing to avoid the temptations modern life has.

Last you need to make smart investments. Put some money into your jobs 401k each month. Don't have a car worth more than 40% of your yearly salary. Get a house that isn't unreasonably priced. 

In some ways your life will be harder than previous generations, but in other ways it will be easier. Overall I would say it is better to be born today than in 1950. Climate change is an issue, but if you are in a first world country it will be more of an annoyance than a crisis."
,Sure is get out of school and apprentice in a trade which will survive this version of progress. Do what you have to do to get out the city and become a pioneer. The past generations strove to go to the moon but society now wants you in your place . Don't eat bugs and don't get forced into cubicle living.

,"I normally wouldn't be this direct to someone so young and would encourage you to enjoy the moments you have while they are good moments, rather than imagining a future that no one can predict. For now, things are somewhat ok, especially if youre wealthy enough to post this from your own computer. 

Since you asked a direct question, you deserve a direct answer which is no. No one will ever again be able to live like we are now or have been since we never returned to peacetime and embraced war as a cultural cornerstone and let the pace of war become the pace of everyday life. It should have been obvious that constant and increasing resource extraction would catch up with us, and should be clear af, now, that it already has. 

This doesn't mean you have no future or that your future can't be better than the lives we lead now, it's just going to be different and there will be no internet  (even if the infrastructure survives, where's the power coming from?). You should be learning how to solve problems as a group in school, as well as what is needed to make your own food and how much food can be produced using different methods. 

Your future, for it to be functional, will be community focused and based on sharing what's available. If we survive, it will be by returning to our niche as tribal scavengers. 

This sounds horrible to someone that's grown up with the comforts you have, but, having spent time with people already living the way the rest of us need to be, they are much happier living as humans, together, than we are, living as humans apart. 

The end of this isn't the end of life, it's the beginning of something new. If you work together, it's the start of something better that will be more satisfying and fun than all the toys and comfort your parents and theirs decided they needed to be happy. And are they happy? Do you see your rich friends having happier lives at home? Doesn't it make sense that if money could buy happiness, there would be a point of wealth where people stopped chasing it? 

You will not have the opportunity to live that life and for that you can be grateful to your parents for making that an impossibility. Beyond that, I would ask your parents why and how they're doing everything to give you a better future, which is the standard line. It doesn't make much sense if they're ignoring the reality youre forced to accept and so not preparing you for that life in any way. If they were doing this for your future, wouldn't they be more focused on what your future actually looks like and how best to prepare you for it, ideally by modeling the life youre likely to lead? 

Im just a guy who decided the best way he could be a father was to not be one and to look for ways to prepare your generation to cope with the world you've been handed. Love is the only emotion that's stronger than fear, and in an emergency, everyone is a communist. Dont get caught up on the labels and treat everyone as a decent and equal human being, unless/until they prove themselves as something else but never let that affect your default. If the default can shift from suspicion to compassion, at least half of the climate problem solves itself. 

More than anything, please be hard on your parents when you see them taking more than they need. Whatever resources they use now will not be there when it's your turn and the burning of those resources will also make life more challenging for your generation. It will be the pressure you guys put on your parents for change that will give us any hope of getting there. 

Best of luck in your future in a new world. It may sound like a shit sandwich but it's also the first time in a long time where humanity will be forced to live a different life and it will be on you and your peers what that life looks like, at least socially. No one can make this future work on their own, and you'll have to start from scratch, but that might be the fix to everything. 

Try to remember that all of the crap we think is important can disappear and youre still you. None of this was necessary and we aren't going anywhere that matters. We live in a zoo we built at the cost of the world outside, which is now much harder to survive in than when we left, but the zoo is out of power, food, and staff, and likely to burn down any second. You can stay inside the zoo or you can learn to live outside it without depending on it for your survival. The zoo is not life and does not define you. You belong to the living world because you are alive. The rest of us have lost that connection by surrounding ourselves with non-life, which adds to our sense of self-importance and control, but also makes us lost without our things. 

This world is a crutch built by cowards who are afraid of the dark. Humans are stronger than this and are happier when we have hard times to make the good ones truly precious. We are also social creatures that are happier, healthier, and more resilient in groups. This has all been a terrible mistake that we can stop at any time, but we can't find the courage to accept danger. If you can find that courage, you'll live a rich and happy life no matter where you are or what you have because you'll always have yourself and the people you can trust to enrich your life. The rest of this is stamp collecting."
,"yes, but you must be brave and venture to a vacant plot of land far away from the cities, and get your hands dirty and your back broken. just like our great grandfathers did. you might shave off a decade or two from life expectancy from your hard journey, though the moments that you are living will be well worth it."
,"Probably the best time in history of mankind to be alive, unless the government locks you down."
,Got off the computer Dewie! You don't want none of this!
,"There have been moments that were easy, while other times were difficult. Each has there advantages. On the downside, there is a great deal to clean up - climate change is going to be ugly. But it is a long, slow ugly. On the upside, you will start to see the progress that will come from the efforts in a way that the older generations will not. Remember, there were two World Wars, a Great Depression, and the fumbling attempt to find our way through nuclear war. You are not the first generation to live in interesting times."
,"Well, just being alive right now is very different than it was 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 500 or 1000 years ago.  No one has really led a ""normal life"".  Its all relative.  

I don't think climate change will have ruinous effects for humanity over the next 50 years.  But things absolutely will be different.  There will be a series of unending problems to solve.  If we solve them, then there will still be a great portion of the world's population that will live comfortable lives.  But if you are in a developed country, you probably don't know the reality that people in poorer countries exist in.  Its pretty awful - right now - in many places."
,"Climate change is a real problem facing the world that will make life a lot harder for humanity the longer it carries on. But it won’t end human civilization or the world at large. Nobody knows what the future holds for us, but there are billions of people out there who care about this issue and are working to fix it. You can help by supporting politicians who care about tackling climate change, maybe eat less meat in your daily life, cut down on consumption where you can, and stay aware about what’s happening in the world. 

My advice is to chase your dreams as far and as well as you can, because you may be surprised how far they’ll take you. Because we don’t know exactly where climate change, you may wind up having the sort of life you want after all. Early humans managed to survive with nothing but fire, animal skins, and each other. We can survive this too."

,"I’m doing it buddy

23 years old at the moment, making $28 an hour but I was just told I’m getting a raise to $38 literally this morning, I own a house and a 2017 f150 and soon will be making enough to support a family, currently making enough to support myself

Hard to live that kind of life in any big city though you’re gonna have to find yourself a small town that booming with skilled trade work and get in as young as you can, I know a 20 year old making $38 an hour who never went to college, and another friend of mine my age is making $55 an hour, only went to trade school for a year

Lucky for me I was born in the gold mining capital of North America that also has a huge forestry and my family was heavy into forestry so I did that for a bit but I recently got into mining as it’s better money and hours

Just find a skilled trade you enjoy like electrician(they make crazy money), millwright, mechanic, etc. get your tickets and giver shit

The other route obviously is go to college and get a job in your field but nowadays student loans are so expensive you’ll be paying it off forever

My sister is in school to be a psychiatrist of sorts and by the time she’s 30 she should be making 100,000+ a year which is great money, but she’ll be so far in debt it’ll take years and years to pay off so financially she won’t be doing as well as she should, me on the other hand I should be able to be making 150,000-200,00 a year by 30 with no debt

I know the stigma around blue collar work but the moneys there if you’re smart and the work isn’t bad if you enjoy what you do

,"I’ll add the adage that ‘comparison is the thief of joy’. Do your best to tune out news that is not local, because there is nothing you can do about it and it won’t really impact you. Social & traditional media sell advertising based on engagement, and people have found that tragedy and injustice are two of the best ways to get attention, and therefore $. The bad stuff is really over-represented in the content we all read on the internet. Instead, interact with people in your community, and get involved in community things (community garden, recreational sports/activities, …)."

,"There is definitely hope. I'm not saying the situation isn't scary, because it is. But it's not an impossible situation. I find that the best way to stay sane is to keep track of the different technologies on the horizon, and their progress. Things like carbon capture, grid energy storage, heat pumps, geothermal, you name it. There is more out there than you probably think. YouTube channels like [Undecided with Matt Ferrell](https://www.youtube.com/c/UndecidedMF), [Just Have a Think](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustHaveaThink), and [Joe Scott](https://www.youtube.com/c/joescott) are great places to start. They are entertaining, and explain things very clearly, including the pros and cons of each. You'll get a sense of what's out there, you may even find something that you'd like to do as a job someday. That could be anywhere from engineering to product management to sales. 

Take a look at what is in the latest climate bill -- [Hank Green on YouTube has a pretty good rundown](https://youtu.be/qw5zzrOpo2s), and it's more promising than people tend to think. 

Keep in mind that every fraction of a degree helps. Ideally we'd stay below 1.5degC warming, and that goal looks impossible at this point. However, 2degC seems possible (if not extremely difficult) and a hell of a lot better than 3degC. 

Definitely vote when you're old enough, and get your friends to vote. In the US at least, young people have absolutely terrible turnout numbers, which is really quite surprising given that this is their future. I am a realist and I know that there are plenty of bad Democrats out there, but we have a two-party system for reasons that are (indirectly) enshrined in our Constitution. So until that changes, if you live in the US, winning the climate battle means voting as many Republicans out of office as possible. It just does.

In terms of living in an eco-friendly way, honestly the best thing you can do is live in an apartment in a city that is close to work, so you can commute via public transit. This will do much more for your carbon footprint than buying an electric car. Suburbs are terrible for the environment. But if you have to live in one, do get an electric car (or a PHEV, which is actually better for the environment if your commute is short) and put solar panels on the roof. Wherever you live, try and get energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Eating vegetarian or vegan helps a whole lot, too (here I am a hypocrite). 

Be careful following others' advice to look into Permaculture. Permaculture has some interesting ideas for a home garden, if you're into that sort of thing. However, it's completely un-mechanizable and will never feed 8 billion people. We do need more sustainable farming practices, but Permaculture is not the answer. Permaculture tends to be based on a lot of economic fallacies, such as the idea that cities are unsustainable or that people can/should literally all become subsistence farmers, and one of its major influencers (Paul Wheaton) is literally an abusive cult leader. So really, be careful. A lot of hippy advice is bad advice."
,"What gives me comfort is that I can say that I have the great fortune to live in what may be humanity's most interesting times.

,"Your post really brought peace to me. I'm 29 and ever since I was little, around 4, I was so heartbroken about the earth and what we're doing to it. The more I learned, the more I dreamt of seeing Earth's beauty and saving it. Why are we chopping down so many trees when we know the negative impact? Why do corporations continue to produce their toxic products even though they know it's polluting our earth? The list goes on, but the thought of how we treat our earth makes me physically sick. I never worried about the end of the world. I thought, oh maybe in 100 years shit will hit the fan. Then, a few years ago when scientists announced that we're in the midst of an extinction, I broke down. I'll be honest. I'm really really scared for the future and it makes me so mad that people don't seem to take it seriously. But what you said reminded me that there are people doing things to help. I want to do something too, but have no idea where to even start. Ive already made small changes in my day to day life like using less waste and less plastic. But I want to do more and idk how."

,"We tend to glorify the past. The boomer generation got their life because their parents had to participate in the bloodiest conflict the world has ever seen. When boomer generation was 20 years old, they were getting mass drafted to go fight in Vietnam, and by the time they were 30 they had to live though the biggest financial recession since the Great Depression."
,"These kinds of comments are so dumb and uninformed. Let's set aside for a moment that boomers lived through inflation and unemployment that exceeds what millennials lived through, and jump straight to the fact that boomers and silents founded just about every environmental organization you can think of. Nearly every vegan guru and author that redditors follow in plant based subs were boomers.

Then we get into the fact that [boomers are living more green](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/22/move-over-millennials-boomers-are-uks-greenest-generation) than younger generations precisely because they don't buy, buy, buy. They were raised by depression era parents and their lifestyle is naturally simple. As [this study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43039-020-00015-4) points out (or maybe it's [this one](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/15198/VanSteenburg_YC_2018_FINAL.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), or t[his one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22390226/), or [this one](https://sci-hub.se/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22390226/)) boomers recycle more, they reuse old clothing more, than turn off appliances when not in use more, they eat more fruits and vegetables instead of take out, etc.

According [this study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43039-020-00015-4) 37% of millennials claim they aren't doing anything for the environment and another 29% only claim to care about the environment for social status. I was just in a thread yesterday where a ton of young people were calling old people weird for reusing plastic utensils and butter containers. ""Ew, just throw it away."" How very green of them.

Point being, young generations today are not living any differently than the boomers, they just claim to care more. Climate change is the cause of their time and everyone wants to fit in but their *actions* don't follow their words. It's easy to sit on social media and cry about the environment but many young people today are not actually making green choices."

,"Hi, thanks for writing :). I'm amazed that you were so conscious about it already at 4. For me, even though I was conscious about some of the pollution, it took me some time to feel the amount or relate to it to my personal choices. In a way I think it really hit me this summer. It hit me that, every single part of our culture has some ""destroying"" nature to it. The way our roads are built that don't allow animals to cross or migrate. Even the way our bike pathways are built. I live in a city where I can move everywhere cycling, but after a rainy day I see a bunch of snails on the bike roads and often some of them get crushed under a wheel. I'm a big fan of snails, but I can't feel hurt by every single one of them. Obviously not everything is avoidable, but we can dial back by a lot most of our worst practices and nature will take as much as we let it.

I don't think humans will go completely extinct this century, even though the potential for crushing our civilization is very high and the human cost will still be huge. I think and hope that we will get to a point where natural catastrophes are so overwhelming that we will greatly reduce our fossil fuel emissions and dial back most of our consumerist practices. I also hope that we will try to outweigh negative impacts on the environment. Even in the worst climate scenarios possible and with many species going extinct, there are also many species that with appropriate care (leaving ecosystems untouched or helping them thrive), will survive climate change. Current parents and people under 45 already grew up with the knowledge that we can entirely destroy our planet and ourselves if we keep on. Some have been railed in by the system to forget or disassociate personal choices from this knowledge, but when the crisis gets worse, ignorance and denial can't keep their stronghold forever. The thing that can keep us moving is to actually think of the positive impacts that we can make and not give up hope of reforming ourselves. We can always begin again to make positive changes and once we start doing good things for the climate, by nature of benefits, I hope we will keep doing them by inertia. 

It's great that you're mindful about waste and plastic. I'm also on the boat of that. I've stripped all of my flights (forever unless emergencies arise), even though I live far away from my family. I think the best choice any of us can do is to steer our careers to positive impacts. It might not be the best paying, but if we can still afford a healthy lifestyle, jobs that have positive impacts on both our well-being and the climate are going to be the most interesting in the long-term. Find the intersection between what you're good at, what you like and which sectors are doing good things in your area. I'm graduating early next year and have found a promising field that does not give thousands of hours of my life to big corporate exploiting everything for profit. It is still in its early stages, but it is another tool to reform agriculture towards sustainability and encouraging biodiversity. I have good and bad days with climate depression and anxiety, but, in the end, we only have this life and we can do as much. Enjoy what you can about life and keep worry about the climate as a reminder about what things are worthy of value and your time. 

I'm a semi-broke student with a part-time job and started donating to a conservation group (Mossy Earth) with the money I used to buy dumb things that I didn't need. Every small step counts and the more conscious you are, the more you communicate positively your lifestyle choices to others, the more others will be encouraged to do the same when faced with climate anxiety."

Here is a paper from *December 2015*, if you want another reminder of how much our perception has changed.

https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2595 

> The world's governments agreed to limit global mean temperature change to below 2 °C compared with pre-industrial levels in the years following the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen. **This 2 °C warming target is perceived by the public as a universally accepted goal, identified by scientists as a safe limit that avoids dangerous climate change**. This perception is incorrect: no scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the 2 °C target as a safe level of warming, and indeed, this is not a problem that science alone can address. We argue that global temperature is the best climate target quantity, but it is unclear what level can be considered safe. The 2 °C target is useful for anchoring discussions, but has been ineffective in triggering the required emission reductions; debates on considering a lower target are strongly at odds with the current real-world level of action. These debates are moot, however, as the decisions that need to be taken now to limit warming to 1.5 or 2 °C are very similar. We need to agree how to start, not where to end mitigation.

If 1.5°C was identified as the target around 1990, I suppose the chances of meeting it would have been considerably better by now. But that is not the world we live in."

I think this is the MOST crucial factor in the fight against climate change, as Brazil is home to much of the Amazon Rainforest, and unfortunately under Bolsonaro, it hasn't seen good times.

Rishi Sunak

The UK has always been very ambitious in acheiving its climate targets. They barely now use coal, and RS is committed to protecting the environment. C'mon, he put back the ban on fracking. Had he not done that, UK's climatical intergrity would have been shredded.

India, home to >1.2 billion people, needs a lot of energy. The last time I checked, 33% of energy used in India comes from renewables, and some states in India are fully green-powered, such as Ladakh. This is a major step, in light that India is a developing country. 

Modi also opened up a massive solar panel project in the south, worth billions of dollars, I am unable to recall the name.

>
> It is true, that for each doubling of CO2 concentration, temperature increases by a constant value. However, at the current level of CO2 content in the atmosphere a good approximate relation is that for each 500 GtC (1833 bn tons of CO2) we can expect equilibrium temperature increase by approximately 1°C. Moreover, because of the continuing exponential growth of CO2 emissions the temperature increase will also accelerate.

,"Why? It doesn’t say anything more than the other 50 articles I have read over the last 20 years.   We are going to be too late.  That’s what this article says and that’s my firm belief.  The longer we fail to get temps in check the more likely extremely negative feedback loops are likely to happen.  
If ice melts the water temp changes 70x quicker.  If you let permafrost melt biological feedback loops produce much more carbon and methane.  If ocean temps get too warm and too acidic aquatic life starts to fail.  Temps on land get too hot too often you get much more droughts which lead to much higher fire risks which create more CO2.   
And if you let conservatives run government they completely ignore climate risks and go off of what makes their country look strong for the years they are in office but fail several years after they get removed.  
So it is very likely we will hit 2.5 to 3C.  And all of that makes it much more likely we will have to try something extreme.   Sulfur aerosol injection is toxic after 20 years or so. It creates acid rain, which causes even more ocean acidification, erosion, damage to trees and life.   Need I go on?"

But the article you provided is saying exactly that:

So I understand the position I believe you're taking, but it's actually commenting on if emissions are increasing at an exponential rate, we will see faster temperature rise throughout the selected period of measurement.

>for each *500 GtC (1833 bn tons of CO2)* we can expect equilibrium temperature increase by approximately 1°C

Which is what the author is alluding to in the first paragraph when they talk about true statements. 

> Moreover, because of the continuing exponential growth of CO2 emissions the temperature increase will also accelerate.

And a part you left out
> Exactly how quickly the temperature will rise will depend on the actual emissions rate.

And 

 > Such rate of growth means doubling the amount of CO2 emissions every 25 years. After 50, 75 and 100 years emissions become respectively 4 times, 8 times and 16 times larger. During the last 25 years we have emitted as much carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burning as from the beginning of the industrial revolution to the 1980s. More precisely, during 27 years between 1986 and 2012 we have emitted more CO2 than from 1751 to 1985 (CDIAC). Continuation of this trend would mean that between year 2010 and 2050 emissions would triple to a level of 100 bn tons of CO2 per year.

>...If the rate of emissions growth continues unchanged, in each subsequent decade we will dispose into the atmosphere ever increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, moving us ever faster to the right and upwards on the graph in Figure 1.
The key word here is *accelerate*. Meaning it will increase in momentum, the temperature increase will be faster. 

So yes, certainly not the amount of warming **per 500GtC of CO2**, but certainly per year."

Quote from the article:
“The demise of 1.5°C does not mean that the fundamental policy implication of the Paris agreement is changed. The world needs to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse-gas levels by massively reducing its emissions and by gaining the ability to reabsorb those emissions that it cannot abate. And doing so more quickly is better. For some, a global temperature target never made sense in the first place. Dr Schrag at Harvard points out that the climate system as a whole mostly operates on a sliding scale, where higher global temperatures bring greater impacts and risks. “1.5°C is not safe and 2.2°C is not the end of the world,” he says.
Scientists do know, though, as the ipcc showed in 2018, that the less the temperature rises, the better. 1.6°C is better than 1.7°C: 1.7°C is better than 1.8°C. As a new mantra has it, “every fraction of a degree matters”. To Dr Schrag, it is never too late. “It is always the case that reducing the severity of climate change is a worthy investment. If we were at four degrees, keeping it from going to six is a noble thing to do.”

It was within the realm of possibility to stay below 1.5c as well, but the developed world overwhelmingly continued to choose a high consumption lifestyle.

Consumption is the crux of the issue, and what's happened since the dawn of the industrial revolution is a decrease in poverty and a corresponding increase in consumption.  94% of the world's population of 1 billion in 1800 existed on the equivalent of $2/day, so only 60 million people lived a higher-than-destitution consumption lifestyle, according to the standards of the day.  Today?  The population is around 8 billion, and only 8.6% exist on that $2/day (as of 2018).  91.4% of that 8 billion, which is 7.3 billion, are living a higher-than-destitution lifestyle now.  And every single dollar equivalent spent comes with an environmental price tag that's rarely incorporated into the price.

,">\-Bad analogy, humans are not a cancer on earth. We are putting the stuff of life back into the atmosphere.

The analogy was telling someone it’s not a problem because it’s happened before, not that humans are a cancer.

>\- Geology is also a science, and more precise and relevant.

So you accept the science of geology. What other science do you not accept besides climate science. And how do you know that it is more precise and relevant?

>\- Geology shows that when the planet was warm and had more co2 there was more life than when it was cold and had less co2.

But not more human life.

>\- There is no crisis.

Climate scientists say you are wrong. And based on the massive improvements made by scientific advancements the evidence shows you are wrong. And based on polls, more and more people are rejecting that statement because they are experiencing extreme weather. The deniers are becoming more and more irrelevant every year.

>\- A warm planet is a happy planet.

How are you measuring the emotions of a planet? But more intense heat waves do not make humans happy or more intense hurricanes do not make humans happy or more intense droughts do not make humans happy or humans losing their property due to rising sea levels do not make humans happy.

>\- It’s easier to grow food with co2 fertilization. Plant food is animal food.

I have never seen a group more concerned about plant life as the denier crowd. You would think they would be more concerned about the welfare of humans since more plants don’t do humans any good. Humans already produce more than enough food to feed the world. The problem is getting the food to the people that need it. And climate change enhances that problem.

>\- Also, everyone will die.

And amazing amount of sensitivity. Recently a couple had their children swept away in a flood. I guess your example of sympathy towards the couple would be to just say “everyone will die”.

Yes everyone dies. But extreme weather kills people sooner than if it had not happened.

>\- But the planet will sustain many more humans as long as politicians don’t get in the way like they are doing in Sri Lanka, Canada, and Netherlands in the name of saving the climate.

That’s to be seen but politicians have nothing to do with the science of climate change.

You seem to be having a problem with reading comprehension because this is the second time I’ve needed to explain to you that the analogy was telling someone it’s not a problem because it’s happened before, not that humans are a cancer. I could have used any disease that afflict humans instead of cancer.

>\-Warm planet is good.

That’s the second time you’ve made that assertion without anything to back it up.

>\-Warm, like the medieval warm period and now, are associated with human flourishing and advancement.

Not only was the MWP not a global event, see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1401-2), but some civilizations collapsed during that period so it wasn’t all good times like you assert see [here](https://www.livescience.com/66032-medieval-megadroughts-return-global-warming.html). You should check out some science instead of just your denier blogs.

>\-The little ice age was associated with starvation, war, disease,

The LIA was also not a global event as shown in the first link. But it does show how even small changes in global temperature can cause large human suffering.

>\- and they still had all of the extreme weather events that you worry about so much.

You seem confused about the LIA. It was a cold period so there was no worry about intensifying heat waves, increased rain and rising sea levels. Those are intensified by a warming planet. And unfortunately it’s only going to get warmer with those problems continuing to intensify."
,"I still don’t get it.  The planet does not have any disease.  Don’t use that analogy.  Weather events are not a disease.  Do you want a planet without weather events?  Never in history has that occurred.  What we can see is less people dying from all weather and climate related deaths ever in the history of mankind, and less absolute poverty.  We are on the way to solving those problems and fossil fuels are part of that solution."
,">\-I still don’t get it.

Some people just have trouble with comprehension. After explain it twice I don’t think a third time will help.

>\-Don’t use that analogy.

I think I will. Just because you can’t understand it doesn’t mean most won’t.

>\-Do you want a planet without weather events? Never in history has that occurred.

No it’s not and neither did I say that. You should really work on your reading comprehension.

The last 8k years have had relatively stable heat and weather until mankind started adding massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which is causing more extreme weather. Civilization developed during those 8k years of relatively stable weather and the recent rapid increase in temperature and extreme weather is threatening that development. And adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is something that mankind can modify.

>\-What we can see is less people dying from all weather and climate related deaths ever in the history of mankind, and less absolute poverty.

Less people have been dying from weather and climate related deaths for the last 150 years because of modern medicine and advancements in climatology that has produced projections about severe weather events using climate science and models. But now people all over the world are beginning to be affected by extreme weather. And just because maybe you haven't, doesn't mean there are a lot of people suffering from that weather.

The adverse results of climate change don’t happen over night, it takes time. But it is only going to get worse as the temperature increases as projected by the climate science models. At this point it is possible to make changes that will be somewhat difficult but not disastrous.  But by the time it gets so bad the deniers have to admit it is getting really bad it will be too late to do what’s necessary without drastic changes.

>\-We are on the way to solving those problems and fossil fuels are part of that solution.

Fossil fuels are causing the problems of extreme weather and that is going to get worse. And just like in the past when we discovered something that adversely affected humans, like lead that improved engine efficiency but hurt our health, we have done something about it. But that was before some started questioning the science. Now we have a group that question the very thing that reduced those deaths and decreased poverty."
,"I have had cancer before.  It’s a dumb analogy.  The planet is better than ever, not worse.  Best time to be alive and getting better.  There is no crisis.

,">\-I have had cancer before. It’s a dumb analogy.

Sorry to hear that. But as I’ve said twice before, I never said the earth had cancer. But you think whatever you want if it makes you feel better.

>\- The planet is better than ever, not worse. Best time to be alive and getting better. There is no crisis.

Try telling that to the millions of people that are being affected by climate change. It seems that you think as long as it hasn’t happened to you then it doesn’t matter what happens to others.

>\-Climate has always been changing since the oceans were 400ft lower.

Well it has been changing long before that and everyone agrees. That has nothing to do with the fact that humans have pumped massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and that heats up the planet.

>\-Some places get worse, some places get better, and yes technology helps, especially fossil fuels.

The problem is that more and more extreme weather is causing more and more suffering in more and more places because of fossil fuels. The evidence is overwhelming. If you don’t accept science that’s up to you but it doesn’t change the facts. And it doesn’t change that more and more people are accepting that fact because they are being affected by climate change.

So if you want to argue the science then present some. Just making assertions doesn't stand up against the evidence."

So regardless of what the WSJ is complaining about those people would not have died early if not for climate change.

The WSJ talks about dishonesty but then references a decrease in heat deaths largely due to air conditioning in the US. That is completely dishonest because poor countries are experiencing more of the effects of climate change and cannot afford air conditioning.

,"\>My question is that give the positive feedback written somewhere else

I have no idea what this means. It doesn't seem like English is your first language, can you explain it a bit better (if you can)? If you mean a positive feedback as in carbon emissions, the Amazon normally burns more than this, and usually it sucks it all back up (pretty much, the amazon is pretty complex). We won't see the amazon as a carbon emitter for a longgggg time.

&#x200B;

\>and also scientists saying that they have under-estimate how fast the planet is warming up

But they haven't, this isn't correct. Look at models for warming projections, they're accurate. Sure ECS is difficult to calculate and we might have underestimated how sensitive the earth is, but even then the earth isn't too sensative during this era ([https://eos.org/research-spotlights/past-climate-sensitivity-not-always-key-to-the-future](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/past-climate-sensitivity-not-always-key-to-the-future)). Plus TCR is entirely more relevant for near term warming. We won't see those high 4-5C numbers before 2100. In fact it'd probably be hard to see even 3C this century assuming we stop before like 2060 or something.

For how much time we have (assuming you mean the 1.5C goal) we probably have even less time than the recent IPCC reports, however at the same time that doesn't mean we're just gone."

,"\> I thought feedback loops are not previously accounted for, and that they are going to make the situation worse? No? 

If anyone tells you this, they're probably misinformed. While they may not be explicitly stated in the IPCC for example, they're certainly used for the scenarios and the like. Some of them have gotten more severe than thought which is an issue, but again it's more of an ECS issue than anything near term. I've dug into ECS a bit more recently but I can say without a doubt they're certainly accounted for, they just might not have the severity accounted for, if any new studies have popped up about them. I'd recommend taking a look at u/aClimateScientist's profile if you want a deeper dive. They give some good sources and considering they're an actual scientist on the topic I trust them.

&#x200B;

\> How about the Amazon .. isn't the fire going to dump a lot of CO2 in the air? Feedback loop or not.  

Depends on how bad it gets. Normally more area burns but tbf it's still going on and people may continue starting fires. But iirc the Amazon definitely soaks up its emissions from fires so I don't see why that wouldn't be the case here.

This comment is illustrative of deniers confusion and logic. We are not concerned about ""change"" but the impacts of that change.

Currently we are adding CO2 to the atmosphere and this is causing warming. But even if we completely stopped our emissions there would be a period of slow warming due to thermal inertia.

>Two global coupled climate models show that even if the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had been stabilized in the year 2000, we are already committed to further global warming of about another half degree and an additional 320% sea level rise caused by thermal expansion by the end of the 21st century. Projected weakening of the meridional overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean does not lead to a net cooling in Europe. At any given point in time, even if concentrations are stabilized, there is a commitment to future climate changes that will be greater than those we have already observed.

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5716/1769](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5716/1769)

That is to say the oceans have not fully warmed due to the CO2 in the atmosphere now.

If we start drawing down CO2 using carbon sequestering then at some point we would pull enough CO2 out the atmosphere to start cooling but this would likely take us years to decades of sequestering.

At that point we would experiance a slow drop in temperatures until we hit CO2 levels of 270ppm, the preindustrial values. It would still take many decades for global temperatures to return to those values.

That is nowhere remotely close to something we have to worry about at the moment.

Simply slowing emissions is a big enough task let alone begining to reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

It is worth noting for readers, CO2 will naturally drawdown if we completely stopped emitting right now.

,"Video: [https://youtu.be/5HHHN2s9ZCA](https://youtu.be/5HHHN2s9ZCA)

Flue gas is harnessed from the Brevik factory chimney it's between 100 to 165 degrees so we have to cool it down to about 30 degrees. This happens in a direct contact cooler the temperature is reduced and caustic soda is added to remove sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid from the flue gas.

The cooled flue gas then goes to the bottom of an absorber. Here co2 molecules in the flue gas react and bind with the amine liquid inside the absorber to become a rich amine solution.

The rich amine solution is then pumped into a desorber where the mixture is heated to about 120 degrees this breaks the bond between the amine molecule and the co2. This is a very energy intensive process and so we use the residual heat from the factory to produce low-pressure steam to heat the rich amine mixture this is truly unique and has never been tried before.

After processing in the desorber we're left with pure co2 gas which goes on to be compressed and dried in the compression facility the pressure is increased over several stages from one point seven bar to seventy bar. The co2 gas is then cooled again and returns to its liquid state before the pressure is reduced to 16 bar.

co2 transit storage in previck and co2 transport liquid co2 is transported to a transit storage facility and is now ready to be picked up and transported by ship co2 from Brevik is transported to a new transit storage facility in Cole's Ness. The result is that we avoid emitting 55 tons of co2 into the atmosphere per hour this equates to an incredible 400,000 tons per year which is the equivalent of the emissions produced by 180,000 cars in a year

,"Bias can be removed from carbon accounting.

Think of it this way: if every company uses the same methodology (far-fetched scenario) and everyone goes net neutral with GHG sequestration. Then GHG emissions flat-line. This would be the theoretical baseline: best accounting practices, right?

I think so. The question becomes \*who\* counts carbon acceleration? Is *Big Oil,* who contracted *Big Tech* to accelerate oil production... or is it *Big Tech* for offering its services to *Big Oil*?

This is where bias comes in. In the most extreme scenario: *Big Tech* will want to push all the CO2e onto *Big Oil*'s books and vice versa.

I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. What I'm focusing on is Microsoft's carbon acceleration. Bespoke tools for *Big Oil* to accelerate the extraction of fossil fuels. (I've never used the tools so maybe they're hogwash)

If Microsoft want to be a leader in the area they have to engage in a conversation. They have said publicly they want engage the question, but in my case they haven't and I've been pretty fair (All my communications [1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TRFUbfZrnuXJcfn5mbN6Fhkwb-3IL6DIKbdYlE_-mMA/edit?usp=sharing), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UApO08IWih9M4-L0tFpxMmmXnllsc9jEpghJWCHP0rI/edit?usp=sharing), are linked in the article).

I think you're conflating *blame* with *who accounts for it*. They are similar but blame can't be quantified.

In some instances, Microsoft is downright misleading. They make the argument they are helping Big Oil companies transition. Even if they exclusively helped in some transition --which they are not-- the large European oil companies do not even have targets that are in line with 2 degrees of warming. (See [May 2020 *Transition Pathway Initiative* report](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/tpi/publications))

They are pushing the accounting to books of companies that plan to fail, lobby governments and gridlock legislation.

The concept of carbon acceleration only makes sense in the context of carbon offsets. Both are flawed concepts and I'm not surprised the concept of acceleration bugs you. But offsets are the concepts Microsoft has used for 8 years and plans to rely on in the future so the counterpoint is fair game. 

If Microsoft wants to buy an offset that delays (not stops) a forest from being cut down then they are just slowing something. Same with buying stoves for poor families to move from charcoal to propane. They aren't stopping anything they are merely slowing it down.

This appears to be incoherent babel."
,"Well, we'll just have to disagree on what's fair game. I think it's fair game to call out lines of thought like this as irrational and unproductive - and will most likely only increase tribalism over the whole issue. I can't see how they could possibly be productive angles on the issue.

I don't really like offsets either but they aren't nearly as bad as this line of thought. I think acceleration severely lacks a sound economical perspective of carbon intensity, demand and supply. Of course I don't know much of the practicalities of offsets either, but just thinking of it theoretically it makes more sense.

I work in tech myself and tightly with the energy industry. I see first hand many tech solutions that are making things better. I think the tech industry deserves it's fair share of blame wrt environmental issues but this is the most ignorantly framed blame imo."
,Babel?
,"In your rational, productive worldview: who counts the carbon then? It seems like your answer is nobody."
,"This wasn't about who counts the carbon. But about what you count. I haven't given it much thought except on the basic level that looking at supply side effects makes little sense and you should focus more on demand-side solutions. Including looking at carbon intensity. This can include counting carbon but doesn't have to. It would be much simpler to just price the carbon right (taxes) and forget about accounting for per company carbon. This has been said by economists since forever. Of course even this is hard to get right.

Looking at the supply side makes little sense in the context of the globalized economic system we live in - if there is demand the system is geared towards generating supply. So we must look at ways to reduce demand. By increasing the prices on carbon-intensive products we reduce demand. It's already happening but needs to speed up. Or then we need to change the system in the way it functions."
,"You kinda lost me. but if what you're getting at is a well priced carbon tax is better than this acceleration deceleration shenanigans then I agree.

But we don't have a global carbon tax. 

If / when we do: there will need to be a robust way of accounting Scope 3 carbon. Otherwise companies will seek and exploit endless loopholes: subcontracts, shell companies, foreign companies.

Microsoft is making huge claims on seeking to use the best accounting methods and I'm calling them out.

,"Personally this major slowdown in travel and economic ""growth"" has been comforting. While it may feel strange to live in this day and age with the current movement ristrictions, we desperately need these kinds of responces to reduce our carbon emissions. The hard part is seeing that this level of action is only being implemented now in responce to crovid-19 rather than climate change which will without a doubt cause greater devastation than these virus fears."
,"I understand and share your concerns. But maybe, and just maybe we can all learn from this situation. For example, what if working from home became the new normal and we could avoid commuters emissions globally? What if the economies and systems become more resilient and self-sufficient?

,"Agreed.

Polish scientists to Germany: Let's not get rid of working tools of climate change mitigation we have. Let's not prematurely close nuclear power plants.,
,AMEN.
,"I am German and I am against nuclear power plants in general. BUT: I also say let our remaining (we already closed half of them) nuclear power plants in operation and shut down our lignite (brown coal) power plants FIRST. It is a question of priorities! And I am not even as urgently against our combined heat-power coal plants, like for instance in Mannheim, where we heat the city with the waste heat of the coal power plant, saving fossil oil for that purpose. Those power plants should remain in operation during the winter, even though I think they should also get shut down during summer, when the waste heat is not even needed. But again: Nuclear power might be good or bad, but prolongating operation of power stations that already are running for decades is a totally different question than constructing new ones. I am especially skeptical towards all this praise for the new generation nuclear power with molten fluoride salt. This might be an interesting development and I am pro researching it, but too many phantastical claims are out, like ""burning old nuclear waste"" and such nonsense."
,"We need to build new ones, not operate decades old plants running off of 70’s era tech. 

But it is much easier to dream about mind mills and solar panels saving us in their entirety than to construct a new nuclear power plant."
,Or lets just keep them open. They are a necessary and key part of solving the climate issues we are facing.
,"I hesitate to bring up Thorium, but so far the *only* negatives I have read in comparison to conventionally fueled designs is that is it is unproven and (related) there is little experience with it.  Otherwise it seems safer, the fuel is cheaper, and tougher to convert to nuclear weapons.  We should be able to design reasonably priced reactors that are inherently safe even in the worst case without external cooling.

Also I think the problem of low and high level waste disposal is glossed over in the popular press."
,"Nuclear has been opposed in Germany for a very long time, the ""Atomausstieg"" (exit from using nuclear power) has been a demand for many years.  The tech is perceived as dangerous and the nuclear waste problem as unsolved.  Even if we neither have bigger earthquakes nor tsunamis, it was Fukushima which finally led to the decision to retire nuclear for good.   While it would make sense from a climate mitigation point of view, any move to turn around from the exit would be met with strong opposition.  Let alone building new plants."
,"Thank you kind sir, I happen to be the person who initiated this letter and spent weeks ironing it out and getting signatures.

Some of the signatories are really well established environomentalists and scientists. We hope our voice is heared."
,"Exactly! Kohleausstieg before Atomausstieg (if you are consistently against). Otherwise the whole effort of Energiewende has a  smaller effect than it could have.

Regarding new technologies: I wouldn't say nonsense, rather we don't know for now. The point is that without public support for nuclear as a family of technologies we will never know."
,"Germany had an awsome thorium reactor THTR300. It was awsome because it could have been a great source of constant power2gas installation, thus enabling more renewables without Nord Stream 2 pipe.

It is a reall shame it was scrapped."
,Is there any political force in Germany arguing to leave those nukes working untill coal and gas is phased out?
,"Actually burning nuclear waste isn't phantastical, it's a proven thing. The problem with most current reactors is that they run at low temperatures, and get their fissile material purely from U-235, which makes up about 0.7% of uranium. Most of the rest is U-238 which is usually thrown away as nuclear waste.

The idea with new reactors is to use coolant with a better thermal conduction coefficient in order to run the reactor at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures U-238 can be bombarded with protons and be turned into P-239, which is more fissile than U-238. That way you can take old nuclear fuel and extract about 100 times the power, out of it.

It might sound too good to be true, but it's not. The science is solid, and has been demonstrated multiple times. China is even building 3 of these reactors now."
,"I am pro nuclear and I say fuck the fancy new designs. France is at 58gco2/kwh, California at 250, Germany at 450. The Nuclear waste ""price to pay""? 2kg/person/year.       
And France divided its CO2/kWh by 10 in 15 years.   
Yesterday nuclear is good enough and fast enough, we just need to repeat what we know worked."

,"The world installed the equivalent in solar and wind of 45 1GW reactors after adjusting for capacity factor in 2018. Those are real and not dreams.

Edit: Why is this downvoted? This is a plain and simple _fact_."
,"All power stations have an estimated operating lifetime (typically a few decades for nuclear power plants), after which they are expected to be decommissioned anyway. The point about premature closure is that plants being closed in Germany are well within their operating lifetimes and it's kind of crazy on a number of levels to deliberately lose this source of low-carbon electricity production from plants which are built and ready to go."
,Agree. But this is the next base :)
,"Thorium was demonstrated to be easily convertible into nuclear weapons. Processing Thorium is even more dangerous than uranium because of higher natural radioactivity. There are benefits, like a higher abundancy on the earth, but all of this is not remotely solved and even IF we go thorium, this will hardly get any impact before year 2040 or so. But then it will be too late to solve our climate problems."
,"Main problem with Th ? It is regulatory - paperwork, operating procedures, testing procedures, maintenance processes and everything legal."
,"There is no time to rely on entirely new tech, before they're built it's 15 years later if that. We need to phase out fossil fuel, most importantly brown coal **now**."
,"Also, molten salt reactors running on uranium, which have the same cost and safety advantages. Some designs are fast reactors which would have the same fuel availability advantage. 

Most of the companies working on molten salt reactors are starting with uranium fuel, about half of them fast reactors. These include Terrestrial Energy, Terrapower, Thorcon, Moltex, and Elysium."
,"Yes, the German stance is clear. But the question is simple: why, in the course of transforming into a low carbon energy system, first get rid of the biggest low carbon source, and only then of the biggest polluters."
,So they get rid of a low emissions source of power and replace it with a high emissions source of power which represents a greater immediate risk in our current stage of climate change.   What sense does that make?  They seem optimistic that they can eliminate coal use within 20 years by shifting everything over to renewables though I think ultimately that will prove to be overly optimistic.
,"sorry, nonsense is a hard word, but I mostly meant this for the exaggerated claims, as if those new reactors could undo nuclear waste products of the past. I think there is far too much enthusiasm in that - and partially biased by the corporations who want to profit from that. Too much fairy tales were told in the past and I am generally very skeptical towards all this downplaying of real dangers as we read far too often. 

&#x200B;

But in general I am not as much against research for future reactors. I am absoltuely pro resarch of nuclear FUSION, like in the ITER project in France. But this will take a lot of time - time that we do not have now to solve our CO2 emission problems. 

&#x200B;

I am German and I think Germans tend to be a bit like Pendulum - often from one extreme to the other. Maybe including myself. LOL"
,"I was a big fan of the THTR300, but it had technical problems. For instance the graphite balls broke up too often on their way. Simplified version: The reactor resembled a bit of a ""sand glass"", those pritive clocks for cooking eggs. Of course it was not  simple at all, but a very complex system. Unfortunately it failed. But yes, it was a prototype, so I guess the technology could have got improved. Problem is, that we have an urgency NOW and our CO2 reductions are required yesterday, so to say. 

&#x200B;

I am even a bit of a skeptic in the question if we ever will need (or be able for that matter) reducing our CO2 footpring to zero. But global reduction by 50% is an absolute priority and should be taken at almost all costs. 

&#x200B;

Therefore I am for an emergency plan until we reach 50% - then we can take more time, in my point of view. Emergency means many things, from speed limits on the German Autobah - even though it might only reduce our national emissions by maybe 0.5%, but every little bit counts. 

&#x200B;

Also running our nuclear plants until we are down to 50% CO2 emissions. 

&#x200B;

Also I demand taxes for airflight kerosine and so on. 

&#x200B;

Luxemburg has FREE public transport now. I know that in Germany regional trains and busses are subsidized (spelling?), but this could certainly get boosted even more. Also I know that big cities like London have some kind of taxes for cars to  drive to their centers, with the exception or electrical cars, I think. 

&#x200B;

Many tiny things can be done almost instantly, if there is a will and I guess they could instantly add up to 10% CO2 reductions even this year. 

&#x200B;

But so far I mostly see talk, talk, talk, even on all sides. Even the self claimed most urgent climate savers compete with higher goals ,while I think they should better compete by what is sooner implementable."
,"that is a very good question! From my point of view I see irrational views on all sides. I support the green party in most what they do, but they originated by the anti nuclear movement (including anti nuclear weapons) of the 1970s, so they have to swallow a really bitter pill so to say, to let the remaining nuclear power plants running longer. 

&#x200B;

On the other end of the spectrum there are deniers of climate change like the right wing party AfD. 

&#x200B;

Then there is the classical moderate right party, the CDU / CSU which classically was always PRO nuclear power, but they lost their main state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in elections right after the Fukushima disaster 2011, so chancelor Merkel did a ""salto mortale"" and instantly cancelled her former plans to let the nuclear reactors run ""forever"" (my hyperbole, but that is what I perceived and I was not happy about the oldest reactors running for much longer). 

&#x200B;

The other parties seem to be ambiguous. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, Fukushima is 8 years ago by now and from my viewpoint the reaction of my fellow German citizens was a bit irrational after Fukushima, like a panic attack. 

&#x200B;

I was much more concerned after Chernobyl 1986 and wished Germans had taken THAT one more seriously than they did. 

&#x200B;

Germany and France are together the heart of the European Union (I claim) and are similar in many ways today, EXCEPT in the stand on nuclear energy. the French are the other extreme, have too many nuclear reactors for my taste, more in relation than any other country. 

&#x200B;

This leads to the strange situation, that during hot summer months, when the French have to reduce their nuclear power not to cook their fish in their rivers, they buy lots of German solar energy, while during winter ,when solar energy is low (even without snowcover) Germany buys lots of French nuclear energy. 

&#x200B;

I think a more balanced approach on BOTH sides would seem more sensible."
,"no, it is not proven at all but just word games. Unburned nuclear fuel or breeed fuel like Uranium and Plutonium is not ""waste"". You could consider the mix as ""waste"" that results from nuclear fission, but nevertheless you can not just throw all of that into a molten salt reactor - this would not work at all. You need to process your ""waste"" to extract unburned nuclear fuel. But under that very same precondition you could just use said uranium or plutonium in classical reactors as well. So you are comparing apples to peas here. And this is unfortunately a very common fallacy.   


This said: what do you mean by ""bombarded with protons""? I think you are actually talking about neutrons, not protons, right?"
,"It did not run too well in 3-miles-island near Harrisburg, in Pripjat near Chernobyl or in Fukushima. Not even talking about the radioactive polution of the irish sea by sellafield reprocessing plant or near disasters like in Forsmark some years ago, when several (!) emergency energy generators failed at the same time. This should never have happened and to me the usual downplay rhetorics only makes things worse.

,"I know that link. For years. Skunk Works did great things in avionics, but they are no experts in fusion whatsoever. This paper is more of a joke to me."
,how high have you calculated the costs of nuclear disasters and of nuclear waste?
,Nuclear is more than twice as expensive as solar and wind by LCOE.
,"I am definitely not trying to promote a nuclear and nothing else policy. 

EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  

the thing is, a lot of people promoting the solar and wind only narrative wind up being fundamentalist and resist nuclear at every step, while this happens, utilities build a net gas or coal plant to meet demand. It’s economics. 

Where as to meet on demand, demands you could have nuclear which emits zero carbon..."
,"But those intermittent sources require backup, and that's almost always from fossil fuels. Some of that energy had to be offloaded at a loss as well. And for a global effort that is now 30 years on, a worldwide equivalent of 45 reactors is pretty sad."
,Names get downvoted here. You must have said something in the past.
,"Those 45GW isnt producing that much power.   
Look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/br4xwi/a_quick_comparison_of_americas_smallest_nuclear/?st=jw2ti0g5&sh=32b83fae) comparison for an example. The nuclear power plant is 1/3 of the windfarm, and still produced 50% more energy."
,Probably because those 45 reactors had about as much impact on carbon emissions as a peashooter would have on an airliner.  The impact of France's adoption of nuclear energy on its carbon output in a very short timeframe is well documented and a viable strategy for averting climate change.
,"Yes it really makes no sense. They have planned decommission dates and while those can be extended and often are, it is crazy to just close it early just...........because and lose the benefits of those remaining years of operation. Its like you take a test and answer all the questions correctly and he gives you a C just because he feels like it. They proved they are within operating limits so let them freaking operate."
,True. I was really encouraged when the US began building a half dozen new reactors in the last 10 years and then all the sudden they stalled out again. That was really disheartening. Right now it still looks really stalled and we were making lots of good progress! My brother works for the Gov in the Nuclear Regulatory Comission and I've gained a really good understanding of the benefits of Nuclear but its just too much of an investment for companies currently. Like renewables the industry needs to be made more financially attractive.
,">Thorium was demonstrated to be easily convertible into nuclear weapons.

Has it?  The DoE's experiments with U233 weren't exactly raging successes and the most cited example was pretty clearly a fizzle.  The Indian Pokhran-II test yielded just 0.2kT.  While much is made of protactinium separation allowing isolation of very pure uranium-233, the personnel at Oak Ridge indicate that is a more difficult problem than it appears in an operating power reactor.  Uranium-232 contamination is likely in a U233 bomb, which will advertise to everyone the presence of that bomb.

That all having been said, thermal spectrum MSRs are not the only means of consuming thorium.  Fast reactors can do just as good, if not a better job of using fertile actinides including thorium, for their fuel.  They also sidestep the protactinium problem and maintain very low concentrations of fissile inventory such that they can be considered to run on low enriched, or even natural, uranium.

>Processing Thorium is even more dangerous than uranium because of higher natural radioactivity.

Uranium-238, the most stable of the uranium isotopes, has a half life of 4.4 billion years.  Thorium-232 has a half life of 14 billion years.  Radioactivity is inversely proportionate to half-life, and so uranium is ever so slightly more radioactive than thorium.  But in either case you're talking absolutely minuscule amounts of radioactivity.

> this will hardly get any impact before year 2040 or so. But then it will be too late to solve our climate problems.

“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”

Better to start today so we can get the reactors up and running by the 2030s when we finally realize storage is uneconomical and solar/wind cannot supplant gas without it.  At the very least an intrinsically safe, cheaper, proliferation-proof reactor to replace the by then 50 to 60 year old Gen II reactors is simply a sound investment to keep us from backsliding into climate change."
,">Thorium was demonstrated to be easily convertible into nuclear weapons.

You can make a nuclear bomb using LFTRs much the same way you can eat 100kg of ghost peppers if you really wanted to.


LFTRs produce Uranium 233 (U233) a weapons grade material poisoned with Uranium 232 (U232) which is a proliferation prophylactic. LFTRs are not designed to be appreciable breeders, they will produce only as much U233 as is required to continue their operation and no more, removing U233 from the equation means the reactor will eventually shut down.

**""To claim that uranium-233 is just as effective as plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons is gross simplification bordering on outright deception.** They have similar values for critical mass, but this leaves out a very important point. The nuclear reactions that consume uranium-233 also produce small amounts of uranium-232, a contaminant that will later be mentioned by the authors but ignored at this stage of the criticism. U-232 has a decay sequence that includes the hard gamma-ray-emitting radioisotopes bismuth-212 and thallium-208. Indeed, the half-life of U-232 is short enough that this decay chain begins to set up within days of the purification of the uranium, and within a few months that gamma-ray flux from the material is intense. These gamma rays destroy the electronics of a nuclear weapon, compromise the chemical explosives, and clearly signal to detection systems where the fissile material is located.""




------------

""However, taking into account the overall fission rate per capture, capture by other nuclei and so on, a well-designed LFTR reactor should be able to direct about 1.08 neutrons per fission to thorium transmutation. **This delicate poise doesn't create excess, just enough to generate fuel indefinitely. If meaningful quantities of uranium-233 are misdirected for nonpeaceful purposes, the reactor will report the diversion by winding down because of insufficient fissile product produced in the blanket.**""

""the proportion of U-232 would be about 0.13% for a commercial power reactor. A year after separation, a weapons worker one meter from a subcritical 5 kg sphere of such U-233 would receive a radiation dose of 43 mSv/hr, compared to 0.003 mSv/hr from plutonium, even less from U-235. Death becomes probable after 72 hours exposure. After ten years this radiation triples.

A resulting weapons would be highly radioactive and therefore dangerous to military workers nearby. The penetrating 2.6 MeV gamma radiation is an easily detected marker revealing the presence of such U-233, possibly even from a satellite.

For personnel safety, any U-233 material operations must be accomplished by remote handling equipment within a radioactively shielded hot cell. This can be designed to make it very hard for any insiders or outsiders to remove material from the hot cell.""

Ultimately any fission reactor's neutron flux can convert U238 to Pu239 or Th232 to U233, but the best designs make that incredibly difficult and expensive.

There is no way to prevent a determined government from building a weapons program from a modified power plant. This is why they are inspected by IAEA. IAEA monitoring (or refusal thereof) makes this public knowledge.

**Any government that has the resources would opt to go the proven route of U235 or Pu239, rather than have to deal with potential U232 contamination.**"
,"Molten salt reactors aren't new tech. They were built in the 1960s at Oak Ridge and ran for a decade. They were so safe the researchers would literally just shut them off and go home. 

Thankfully, China has taken the initiative with this technology. They will begin production of a test plant next year. They expect to mass produce commercial reactors a few years after that."
,"If only we could just wave a wand and make all the need for sustainable baseline power sources vanish?    The reality is that power grids will continue to largely be backed up by nuclear, coal or gas.    There is no other viable alternative currently.  Germany has done more in the way of investing in renewables than any other nation on Earth and even they had to face the limitations that come part and parcel with solar.   So now instead of nuclear, they are burning coal, and now their emissions are increasing and will be increasing for the near future, especially as they close more nuclear reactors."
,"I can explain the waste claims.

Only a small portion of nuclear waste is fission products, the broken up atoms that actually fissioned and produced energy.

A bit more is U235 that didn't get fissioned, because fission products that are neutron absorbers built up and stopped the fission reaction. France uses this U235 when it reprocesses its waste, removing the troublesome fission products.

Most of the long-lived radioactive waste is plutonium and other elements heavier than uranium. These are formed when heavy atoms absorb a neutron but don't fission. Some of the plutonium fissions in a conventional reactor, but most is left over. And the bulk of the waste is U238, which is at least 98% of the original fuel. It doesn't fission at all in a conventional reactor. All the other stuff gets mixed in with the U238 and we just discard everything.

Molten salt reactors remove the fission products as they go, so they can burn up all the U235, and more of the plutonium. But the real win is fast reactors, whether molten salt or other types. Conventional reactors slow down the neutrons with water or graphite. Fast reactors don't. The fast neutrons can fission all the plutonium, transuranics, and even the U238. 

That's why we could fuel advanced reactors with nuclear waste. Only about 1% of the waste is fission products; fast reactors can use the rest. Their own waste would be almost entirely fission products, which are relatively short-lived. Encase them in glass and bury them, and they'll be back to the radioactivity of the original uranium ore in about 200 years."
,Luxemburg has free transport because they have cheap and clean electricity from Nuclear France...and yet they are against nuclear power with Austria.
,"But they will never swallow this pill. These plants will shut down in 2 years, and 72 TWh of clean energy per year will be lost. Forever.  THis is equivalent of 2/5ths of Polish energy consumption, and 5 times all of wind power generation in Denmark.   


Why is this not in the news all of the time? These nukes will be replaced by coal and gas on 1st January 2023."
,"> You could consider the mix as ""waste"" that results from nuclear fission, but nevertheless you can not just throw all of that into a molten salt reactor - this would not work at all. You need to process your ""waste"" to extract unburned nuclear fuel.

That's precisely the process described by both Elysium Industries, and Mr. Gates' Terrapower, both of which are working on Molten Chloride Fluid Reactors. The ""process"" in this case is reported to be little more than chlorinating the fuel rods, with no separation of actinide isotopes.   Elysium states that their fuel fabrication approach has been deemed to not qualify as reprocessing by the US DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration.

Fission products present in the fuel rod and carried into a fluid fueled fast eactor by fuel preparation would first of all be of sufficiently low concentration to not cause a solubility problem, and would then be removed by the on-line removal system required for the reactor to operate."

>This said: what do you mean by ""bombarded with protons""? I think you are actually talking about neutrons, not protons, right?

Oh, yeah, I guess I was talking about neutrons. I think my brain was going to the beta decay that occurs in the process of turning U-238 into U-239 (with a neutron) which undergoes two beta decays which leave additional protons, which turn it into P-239. Anyways, that's beside the point.

Turning U-238 into P-239 is very much proven, because that's how P-239 exists. It isn't found naturally. 

Waste is probably a poor term, because it makes it sound like it's just random elements in the waste. Almost all of it is U-238. Generally most plants get rid of the nuclear fuel once there is about 1% U-235 left, which is the fuel that light water reactors use.

Reactors that can provide more neutrons can turn U-239 into P-239, which can be used in standard reactors. The P-239 decays into U-235, which just helps things. There's no need to extract the ""unburned fuel"" for use in standard reactors if you can increase the amount of P-239 and U-235. 

Typical molten salt reactors don't just burn nuclear waste, that's true. What they do is they have much more neutrons in motion which turns more U-238 into P-239, thereby getting a lot more power out of the same amount of nuclear fuel as a standard reactor would use. However, these still need to be enriched to normal levels to get fission started.

There are, however, breeder reactors in operation that although they use a highly enriched core in order to provide sufficient neutrons, they do turn fuel that is unusable for standard reactors into something that is easy to use. There aren't many of these reactors in operation, but there are some being built. The Russian BN-800 is already in operation, and does produce more fuel than it uses.

Either way, there's definitely potential in newer nuclear plants that should be researched and funded."
,"Does this counts as ""downplay rhetorics"":      
[WHO](https://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/backgrounder/en/) on Chernobyl: ""The Expert Group concluded that there may be up to 4 000 additional cancer deaths among the three highest exposed groups over their lifetime (240 000 liquidators; 116 000 evacuees and the 270 000 residents of the SCZs). Since more than 120 000 people in these three groups may eventually die of cancer, the additional cancer deaths from radiation exposure correspond to **3-4%** above the normal incidence of cancers from all causes."" [Here](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78218/1/9789241505130_eng.pdf) is what they say about Fukushima: ""The present results suggest that the increases in the incidence of human disease attributable to the additional radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident are likely to remain **below detectable levels**"" [or](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/11/15-168187/en/) ""In contrast with the findings of only marginal internal radiation contamination among children and adults, it appears that the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases and mental health problems may **outweigh the burden of disease caused directly by radiation**"". [Or](http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2013/UNSCEAR_2013_GA-Report.pdf): ""The most important health effect is on mental and social well-being, related to the enormous impact of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident, and the **fear and stigma** related to the **perceived risk** of exposure to ionizing radiation."" (I let you find the TMI data)        
(it's funny because WHO include many non nuclear (if not anti-nuclear) countries who also approved the report; are they also bowing to the nuclear lobby?)

Thank you for the Forsmark incident. CCF are always bad and I would have kicked some asses there. However, EDG ""failure"" is different from ""failure to start"", which is easy to remediate (it is just regrettable that it needs human action). Greenpeace claiming a meltdown within 2 hours is laughable, even Fukushima didn't melt that fast."

,"France had nuclear for almost 50 years, our electricity is cheaper than in Germany."
,"I'll calculate nuclear ~~waste~~ spent fuel as soon as we're allowed to literally do anything with it, like turning it back into fuel.

For disasters I'll calculate the costs as soon as we have any on a reactor with containment. You know, like _all of them_ have in the states 'n _not russia_?

I mean, if we wanna count disasters globally across all power sources, how many chernobyls would we need to approach the death count of [a single hydro power disaster in China](https://www.ozy.com/flashback/230000-died-in-a-dam-collapse-that-china-kept-secret-for-years/91699)?

Should we require all hydroelectric dams in the states to double up on their building reinforcement due to an accident in another country that didn't have any of their safety design choices in place, and then complain that they're ""too expensive and not competitive against gas"" when they do?"
,"The problem is with your wording. ""Dreams"" makes it sound like renewables don't make any impact. The opposite is true right now. Nuclear is flat at best and realistically declining. There are more closures than new capacity gets added.

And if you bring up economics then nobody will build nuclear either. It's more than twice as expensive as gas, wind or solar."
,"""global effort"": 

yes, but would you really want nuclear reactors to solve energy demands in countries/states like Syria, Somalia, yemen, gaza and so on? regardless if we use nuclear power in Europe, the USA, Japan and so on, it can not solve the energy demands of the earth."

,"The first generation of the green party, who was most determined against nuclear,  already left. And the 2nd and 3rd generation even approved the NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia.

,"Most of what you write is just ordinary ""breeding"", like when neutrons transform U238 into Pu239. This is old stuff - the Hiroshima Bomb worked differently, but the Nagasaki bomb ""fat man"" was totally based on breeding this Plutonium. No need to go into the details here, when a thorium reactor does basically the same - just with the difference that it breeds U234 from Thorium. Different fuel, but similar process. There are even Thorium reactors that are not using molten salt, even though it seems the most promissing new tech. 

&#x200B;

What especially is the very same is the requirement for fuel processing, ""filtering"" the useful isotopes from the decay products, the ""real waste"", if you will. 

&#x200B;

The main difference between molten salt reactors and the classical fuel process with pressurized water reactors for instance is, that the primary system can run almost pressureless and can not suffer the typical core melt, because it already is molten. 

&#x200B;

So something like in Fukushima could not have happened. 

&#x200B;

but there are other issues still. 

&#x200B;

I fail to see how what happened to the irish sea, pollution by ""escaped"" waste products from fuel processing could not happen in a molten salt reactor that is fuel processing all the time. It appears to me that the molten salt is even more vulnerable to some kind of leakages. 

&#x200B;

I am not against this system. I am pro research. But salt is proverbially known to be corrosive and for hot molten salt this is even more true. The prototypes so far had issues with metal build up inside the tubes as far as I know. 

&#x200B;

And I really dislike this ""burning nuclear waste"" mythology, because by the same logic you would claim the very same for classical pressurized reactors. IF you process their remains to new fuel, you would do basically the same. The main reason this is not done are the problems with fuel processing. How will those not arise when doing with molten salt?"
,"Generally I trust the WHO, but below detectable levels does not mean not existent. I live in south west Germany in a region that was allegedly NOT hard hit by the fallout and still I saw malformed chicken with my very eyes in that year - never before or after 1986. They did not make it into the news, let alone a scientific study. Yes, I know this counts as ""anectodical evidence"" that is of low value to others, because only I know that I did not make this up. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless it would be interesting looking up who delivered the data for these WHO claims. Seems you have only read half of my comments, because as much as I found the reaction of the German public too mild after Chernobyl, I found it far exaggerated after Fukushima. Why do you not comment on that? 

&#x200B;

To Forsmark: This was the first link I found, but I remember a much better one. The question is not what Greenpeace claims about a 2 hour meltdown or whatever.  The question is, that this should never have happened in the first place.   


ALL major nuclear accidents were in some way related to emergency energy generation. Even Chernobyl, which was paradoxically a ""safety test"" for emergency energy generation.   


Fukushima was of course more direct related to that. They had not even enough energy to operate their instruments, so they had no clue what was going on in the reactors. 

  
It appears a bit counter intuitive to me, how they seem not able to get this problem into their grip. Usually one would expect more problems with aged steel pipes or whatever. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Under this aspect I find those events in Formark topgrade concerning, that their emergency generation did not work as expected - and this even without any severe cause like a tsunami or stupid operators. 

&#x200B;

The whole concept of redundancy is in question, when the per se great idea of just adding independend systems does not work, because they turn out to be not independent. I say: This concerns me quite as much as any real disaster, because it demonstrates, that all those probability calculations, which are based on independent probabilities, can not be trusted. 

&#x200B;

and again: This downplay rhetoric - and pardon me, your argument reminds me on that - makes me even more suspicious."
,"yes, but that is exactly the point! It is not as if research in nuclear fusion started just yesterday. The Russians invented the Tokamak decades ago and right now the ITER project is about to get started. There is also research in Greifswald/Germany, but ITER is probably the most severe prototype so far. Things are much more complicated than Lockheed wants us to believe.   


This Lockheed page is by now around 5 years old and I have not seen anything substantial since then. Does look not exactly promissing to me.

Lol it’s about facing the engineering realities of what it take to power a grid. 

Renewables are definitely part of the solution and a great fit for many applications but you cannot power New York City or Chicago with renewables alone. You have to supply base load demand. 

If you want to solve the problem of Climate change you must approach all solutions. Or else your just choosing what makes you feel good, while the market will have gas plants built to meet the demands that renewables cannot."
,"I've yet to see a single nuclear advocate claim that we should use nothing but nuclear in the whole world. We should use nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, and every other zero-carbon energy source."
,"So you think that no one should have nuclear power because nations representing a fraction of the global population, and a much smaller fraction of emissions,  are led by crazies? 

About six nations represent 60% of carbon emissions, and all of them already have nuclear power. (Example among several sources: [https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html)) In fact, look at the next 20% of emissions. Most of them already have nuclear power or are building it today. So your point really doesn't make any sense."
,"Why is it we fall back on these environmentally determinist arguments?  The noble savages of the hinterlands cannot possibly be civilized enough to handle such modern technologies and thus must make due with hunter-gatherer energy generation!  What's next? Some reference to rain following the plough?

If you fear nuclear enough to deny its use by countries you deem incapable of handling it then the possibility always exists of creating carbon-neutral or negative fuels at nuclear power stations in countries you deem reliable to power those wayward countries.  But really it's probably simpler to just develop denatured MSRs, FFRs, and other proliferation resistant, intrinsically safe reactors."
,Alright. Your edit made it more clear.
,"> France has an installed nuclear capacity of 63GW. That's in the same ballpark. The world added the equivalent a complete France of nuclear reactors in just one year. And this year it's going to be even more.

I've never quite understood why installed capacity is held up as an example of progress in this regard.  The continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions is only too obvious.  Yet Frances' decline in GHG emissions after adopting nuclear energy is well documented.  If we are really installing the equivalent of the nuclear fleet of France in solar on an annual basis then we'd expect that new generation to have as great an impact as nuclear did in France.  But, again, emissions continue rising unabated.  The only logical conclusion that can be reached is that the promises of wind and solar being low carbon generation are fundamentally flawed.  

>As long as nuclear is prohibitively expensive nobody is going to build it. 

More importantly, as long nations and states which have heavily invested in wind and solar fail to meet their climate goals we'll all drown if we do not invest in nuclear energy.  Nuclear is the perfect partner to wind and solar, making up for their higher carbon emissions."
,"Link? 

Ill sign no problem. I mean Germany is for all intents and purposes a world leader in the conversion to renewable energy but they need to realize nuclear is a part of that as well."
,And yet despite that solar and wind have crossed the threshold somewhat into being less expensive than coal and natural gas.

LFTRs produce only enough U233 sustain their own operation and no more, remove U233 for weapons and you shut the reactor down in the process. 

All LFTRs produce U233 that is contaminated with U232, and we have no technology currently to remove that U232 contamination. 

The U232 has daughter fission products bismuth 212 and thallium 208 which are hard gamma emitters. 

What this means is any weapon made with U232 will announce it's presence and location to satellite gamma detectors, and terrestrial gamma detectors.   It will not be a secret. 

Next these gamma rays pose a serious danger to people handling the weapon, to the electronics in it, the chemical explosives in it, ordnance components in it.

Our attempt at weaponizing U233 was a failure.

- Melting down isn't a risk; ""meltdown"" is their operational state.
- A freeze plug is all that's needed to drain the molten salt in the unlikely event of a temperature overrun. 
- They operate at atmospheric pressure.
- The fact that its a molten salt means that there's a negative feedback loop already built in. (I.e., as the reactor heats up, the molten salt expands; as it expands, the fissile material gets further apart, slowing the reaction.)

Honestly, the only serious problem I have yet to find with this technology is that we abandoned it. Now China is running with it. Good for them."

Please note:

A mil is a measurement that equals one-thousandth of an inch, or 0.001 inch. One mil also equals 0.0254 mm (millimeter). Thus a mil is not the same thickness as a millimeter. The term ""mil"" is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.

(page 22)

SUMMARY

As a result of these studies, we have found that Hastelloy N exposed
in salt containing metal tellurides such as Li Te and Cr Te undergoes
grain boundary embrittlement like that observed in the MSRE. The
embrittlement is a function of the chemical activity of tellurium
associated with the telluride. The degree of embrittlement can be
reduced by alloying additions to the Hastelloy N. The addition of 1 to
2 at. % Nb significantly reduces embrittlement


...


We have found that if the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in fuel salt is kept
below about 60, embrittlement is essentially prevented when CrTel.266
is used as the source of tellurium.

,"**ITER**

ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject, which will be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment. It is an experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor that is being built next to the Cadarache facility in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance, in Provence, southern France.ITER was proposed in 1987 and designed as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, according to the ""ITER Technical Basis,"" published by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 2002. By 2005, the ITER organization abandoned the original meaning of the acronym iter, and instead adopted a new meaning, the Latin word for ""the way.""The ITER thermonuclear fusion reactor has been designed to produce a fusion plasma equivalent to 500 megawatts (MW) of thermal output power for around twenty minutes while 50 megawatts of thermal power are injected into the tokamak, resulting in a ten-fold gain of plasma heating power. 

Thereby the machine aims to demonstrate the principle of producing more thermal power from the fusion process than is used to heat the plasma, something that has not yet been achieved in any fusion reactor.

Secondly your logic is wrong here. No breeder reactor ever (!) was per se limited to a factor of 100%, meaning - quote - ""remove U233 for weapons and you shut the reactor down in the process.""  


This claim just makes no sense. In reality there is always some loss of neutrons, so any process that is by nature limited to 100% would not be sustainable in the first place. The physics must deliver more than 100%, say 130% (as an example) and then you can technically optimize not to lose more than the overflowing 30%, so ultimately you get a factor of at least 100% as you claim. 

&#x200B;

But then again you can optimize a bit more and you get 110% or whatever. 

&#x200B;

Those are intentionally uses simple words without technical terms. 

I know about those issues with danger for the operators who try making nuclear weapons from thorium. And this is reason enough that no country would prefer such a route if they can rather use the classical method of either enrichment of U-235 OR of breeding Pu-239. 

&#x200B;

But who said that nuclear weapons will be limited to countries? We know that a dozen terrorists flew airplanes into buildings on 9/11, so why would they not sacrifice their lives for making nuclear weapons? 

&#x200B;

I do not say how likely this is. I only objected - and still do - that claim, that Thorium is safe in matters of nuclear weapon proliferation. It could be consideres ""safer"" than the classical way, if you accept this compromise in wording.   


Interesting last sentence of yours:   


"" Operation Teapot MET was a mixed core Uranium 233 (Bred from Thorium),  and Plutonium 239 weapon and had such a low yield it was attributable to  it's Plutonium 239 content alone, and was considered a failure.""  


I think this leads to the most likely situation that could arise, if we run like 100 thorium reacors all across the earth: Terrorists could get hands on ""some"" Pu-239, but maybe not enough for a really devasting bomb, so they could get hands on some more U-233 and decide to make some kind of dirty bomb that would not have much higher energy release, but much higher fallout.

I am not making such a claim, only that of all the options on the table enriching U-235, breeding Pu-239 or breeding U-233,  U-233 will be the most expensive, most difficult, and most dangerous.

**what I said was:**

You can make a nuclear bomb using LFTRs much the same way you can eat 100kg of ghost peppers if you really wanted to.


LFTRs produce Uranium 233 (U233) a weapons grade material poisoned with Uranium 232 (U232) which is a proliferation prophylactic. LFTRs are not designed to be appreciable breeders, they will produce only as much U233 as is required to continue their operation and no more, removing U233 from the equation means the reactor will eventually shut down.


...

Ultimately any fission reactor's neutron flux can convert U238 to Pu239 or Th232 to U233, but the best designs make that incredibly difficult and expensive.

There is no way to prevent a determined government from building a weapons program from a modified power plant. This is why they are inspected by IAEA. IAEA monitoring (or refusal thereof) makes this public knowledge.

Terrorists alone might also have issues, but there can be a grey zone, some contacts of terrorists and government participants who do not follow the official lines or whatever.

Cooperation between different governments also made the atomic bombs of South Africa, France and Israel possible. There is a lot of grey zone. Of course this does not undo physical limits. I am not claiming it does. 

But I object your prediction of what ""any government ..... woult opt to go"" or not. 

I give you, that a purely thorium based nuclear weapons design would appear unnecessary hard to achieve, but it could certainly assist in the other given ways. Again: I am not against this research, but I am against premature assertions like it would be no issue for nuclear weapons proliferation."
,"""LFTR's neutron economy contributes to securing its inventory of nuclear materials. Neutron
absorption by uranium-233 produces about 2.4 neutrons per fission--one to drive a subsequent
fission and another to drive the conversion of Th-232 to U-233 in the blanket molten salt. Taking
into account neutron losses from capture by protactinium and other nuclei, a well-designed LFTR
reactor will direct just about 1.00 neutrons per fission to
thorium transmutation. This delicate balance doesn't create excess U-233, just enough to generate
fuel indefinitely.""

To breed more U233 than was required to sustain the reactor you would have to build a fast spectrum reactor not a thermal spectrum reactor like a LFTR.

Instead spending billions pioneering new technologies, you would stick to tried and true designs like the sodium cooled fast breeder reactors Russia uses and breed Plutonium 239 from Uranium 238, and also side step the Uranium 232 contamination issue in the process.

Given the budget we could go to the moon, mine helium-3 and then use that in a weapons program to build thermonuclear weapons.

Given enough money you can do lots of silly stuff.



If you want a weapons program your choices are enriching uranium 235, breeding plutonium 239, or breeding uranium 233.

Of those three options breeding uranium 233 is the most expensive, most dangerous and most difficult.

Can it be done?

Yes, but then so can lots of other absurd things given an infinite budget.

,">Your ""reply"" distracts from what I explicitly said and literally refers to what I clearified not to have said. 

I described how the fuel reprocessing in a LFTR using molten salt, is a completely different animal from reprocessing solid fuel. 

If a leak occurs anywhere in the reactor it goes to the drain tank.  

The bit about the drain tank applies to the on site chemical reprocessing as well, and that is why it I mentioned it."
,"if things are that simple, why did sellafield leak so much radioactivity in the first place? And yes I know it is a different type of fuel, but even more so I ask, how can such amounts of radioactivity escape from processing solid fuel? liquid fuel does not per se appear less ""leakable""."
,">if things are that simple, why did sellafield leak so much radioactivity in the first place? 

Again you are comparing apples to oranges. 

Your question is a bit like asking why a 1971 Ford Pinto will explode if you tap the bumper with a hammer, and why driving a M1A2 Abrams would be any safer.

>how can such amounts of radioactivity escape from processing solid fuel?

In Sellafield the solid fuel is chopped up and dissolved in Nitric acid before processing.  They store waste outside in concrete lined ponds which reportedly have cracked open. Other sites claim they eject contaminated waste water into the ocean without distilling it to remove radioactive contaminants.  If this is true I don't know, but it sounds like it is severely underfunded and that it was poorly designed and managed. 

>liquid fuel does not per se appear less ""leakable"".

Molten becomes solid once leaves the reactor and is allowed to cool via convection, the fission products at the end of the process would be encapsulated in glass to render them stable for long term storage.  The entire reactor basin is a catch pan flowing to the drain tank for passive safety."
,"spare me your weird analogies. So you can not tell me, why all the problems you mentioned in Sellafield can not possibly happen with fuel processing of molten salt. Yes, molten salt will turn solid when cooled down, but also salt is solutable in water, right? I see no conclusive answer to my question."
,"> So you can not tell me, why all the problems you mentioned in Sellafield can not possibly happen with fuel processing of molten salt. 

Because you aren't chopping up solid fuel, and then dissolving it in vats of nitric acid and storing things in open storage ponds with cracking concrete liners and dumping waste water you haven't even bothered to distill in order to remove radioactive waste into the ocean?

Those sound like good starting places to me. 

> Yes, molten salt will turn solid when cooled down, but also salt is solutable in water, right? I see no conclusive answer to my question.

The salt would go into the drain tank if needed until repairs could be enacted.  

In theory we wouldn't be (or at least should not be) building LFTRs in areas that can flood.

The fission products will be separated and encapsulated in glass rendering them stable for long term storage.  The salt is then reused in the reactor, it isn't stored in some storage pond with a cracked concrete liner.   

It sounds like Sellafield is severely underfunded, and poorly designed and managed.

Keeping nuclear waste in open ponds with cracked concrete liners and dumping waste water that hasn't been distilled to remove fission products in the ocean isn't something anyone should be doing."
,"So are you saying that all what went wrong in Sellafield could have been avoided, if they did it more honestly. No principle difference between fuel processing of pressurized water reactors or molten salt reactors? 

You say ""until repairs could be enacted"". Well yes, unless there is some kind of accident spilling lots of water across the solidified salt. 

Which leads to the question: What can be done, when the molten salt solidifies where it should stay liquid, like say in the heat exchanger, amidst 100s of tons of liquid water? 

I am not against research of this concept, but I do not see how it is ripe for planting 100+ such reactors full size across the planet. 

By experience such things all take much longer than projected, even if they ultimately work out well. 

But what we do not have today is time. We need significant CO2 emission reductions within the next 10 years. 

Nuclear power plants can - if at all - only do that with technology that is already fully developed. Not in some kind of prototype state. 

And we have heared too often what can never go possibly wrong - but then it went wrong anyway."
,">So are you saying that all what went wrong in Sellafield could have been avoided, if they did it more honestly. 

If Sellafield is storing nuclear waste in ponds with cracked concrete liners, and dumping waste water that has not even been distilled yet to remove fission products, then yes those things assuming  they are true can most certainly be avoided."

No that certainly is not true. I gave you a comprehensive breakdown of how chemical repossessing works in a LFTR here:

You plan on building a LFTR on the ocean floor?  

We shouldn't be building LFTRs in places that can flood period."
,">I do not see how it is ripe for planting 100+ such reactors full size across the planet.

They offer most all the benefits of fusion power, virtually unlimited fuel, impossible to melt down, and thousands of times less transuranic waste.

LFTRs produce thousands of times less transuranic waste (which requires 10,000 year containment), fully 1/3rd of a LFTRs waste stream are components which can be separated and sold to the scientific and medical communities, and are in very high demand. The very small amount of waste they do generate can easily be encapsulated in glass and placed at the bottom of the Marianas Trench where in a few hundred years it returns to the baseline radioactivity from the ore it came from.

LFTRs really do provide most of the benefits of fusion from a technology we proved viable more than 50 years ago.

MSRs similar to LFTRs could be used to burn down existing waste stockpiles as well, which is a much better solution than long term storage."
,">But what we do not have today is time. We need significant CO2 emission reductions within the next 10 years.



>Nuclear power plants can - if at all - only do that with technology that is already fully developed. Not in some kind of prototype state.

Then we need Gen 3.5 plants with core catchers and passive safety yesterday, and we need complete nuclear fuel reprocessing done right yesterday.   While we wait we need to fully fund and perfect LFTR development, and transition over to it as soon as is humanly possible."

,">But your reasoning seems to ignore everything what actually went wrong in history of nuclear power 

Fukushima Daiichi, Chernobyl and three mile island were water moderated reactors.

Pressurized water reactors are kept at over 70 atmospheres of pressure. Think of them like big pressure cookers waiting to explode, because if cooling is lost that is exactly what happens. Water kept at over 300°C flashes to steam and expands by a factor of 1000.  We have to build in so many redundant safety systems to keep the core cool at all costs to avoid an explosion and subsequent melt down.

A LFTR is not kept under pressure, there is nothing to explode.

The worst event that can possibly occur in a LFTR is the contents of the reactor wind up in the drain tank, fission stops, and the contents solidify until repairs to the reactor can be made. Meltdown is impossible as criticality can not be maintained outside of the core.

The basin of the reactor building acts as a catch pan that flows to the drain tank.

Criticality is maintained in the core by graphite moderation.

During normal operation you have a plug of salt that is kept frozen by a fan blowing air over it.

If power is lost, or some accident occurs the freeze plug melts and the contents of the reactor drain to the drain tank.

The drain tank does not have graphite moderators, and as soon as fission stops convection alone is enough to deal with the decay heat of the fission products. The salt solidifies until repairs can be enacted."
,"Videos are nice, but I am more interested in things that actually went wrong when no one before thought this possible. 

it seems that the most well known problem, failure of emergency power generation can not be got reliably (!) under control. And this seems to be a problem in many other cases as well, like in this incident in Forsmark, Sweden. 

I am really annoyed by now of these constant downplaying words ""at no time there was any risk"", yes, until there is a disaster.

,"Maybe you can stop your permanent condescending tune, no? You talk to me like to a child. Actually in NONE of those major disasters the pressure of the primary cycle was relevant to the cause of the problem. Yes, ultimately they exploded, but not because of the rated pressure of ""over 70 atmospheres"". Yes, the loss of cooling was the main issue - here you are right. 

But it seems that they could not get their emergency power supply reliably (!) running. And this seems to be a problem in many other cases as well, like in this incident in Forsmark, Sweden. 

I am really annoyed by now of these constant downplaying words ""at no time there was any risk"", yes, until there is a disaster. 

I know that molten salt is a different concept. What is not different is that rhetorics, talking to adults as if they were childs. 

I can not speak for others, but to me this tune only fuels my distrust of people who propose such potentially dangerous technology.

,"> Videos are nice, but I am more interested in things that actually went wrong when no one before thought this possible.

Alvin Weinberg clearly understood light water reactors when scaled up for civilian power generation would not be safe.

The worst event that can possibly occur in a LFTR is the contents of the reactor wind up in the drain tank, fission stops, and the contents solidify until repairs to the reactor can be made. Meltdown is impossible as criticality can not be maintained outside of the core.

The basin of the reactor building acts as a catch pan that flows to the drain tank.

Criticality is maintained in the core by graphite moderation.

During normal operation you have a plug of salt that is kept frozen by a fan blowing air over it.

If power is lost, or some accident occurs the freeze plug melts and the contents of the reactor drain to the drain tank.

The drain tank does not have graphite moderators, and as soon as fission stops convection alone is enough to deal with the decay heat of the fission products. The salt solidifies until repairs can be enacted."

If you feel he was wrong then I would direct you to examine the evidence of Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi, and Three Mile Island.  History has proven Alvin's concerns about the safety of the light water reactor to be valid."
,">failed multiple (!) emergency generators not working properly

A light water reactor runs at over 70 atmospheres of pressure, water kept at over 300°C will flash to steam and increase in volume by a factor of 1000.   This is what causes explosions if containment is lost in the pressure vessel.   If the fuel rods are not kept cool they will melt down through the floor of the reactor.  

This is why we need to use engineered safety systems to make sure cooling is maintained and the fuel rods are kept cool to prevent a disaster such as this.   

In a LFTR nothing is kept under high pressure to cause such an explosion, they operate at atmospheric temperatures.   Criticality is maintained in the core only by graphite moderators, without them the reactor cannot remain critical.   In normal operation you keep a plug of frozen salt by blowing air over it, if anything goes wrong the plug will melt and and the reactor will drain into the drain tank which is passively cooled via convection.  Fission stops and the salt solidifies.     

We do not need to engineer any safety systems, as the reactor is passively and inherently safe by design."

to leave the nuclear business and

Weinberg was really kind of horrified

that they would have this response to

him because he wasn't questioning the

At normal pressures, water will boil at 100 degrees Celsius. This isn't nearly hot enough

00:13

to generate electricity effectively. So water cooled reactors have to run at over 70 atmospheres

00:18

of pressure. You have to build a water cooled reactor as a pressure vessel. The number one

00:22

accident people worry about...

00:24

Pressure is lost, water that's being held at 300 degrees Celsius [makes splashing sound]

00:28

flashes to steam. Its volume increases roughly by a factor of 1000. If you don't get emergency

00:34

coolant to the fuel in the reactor, it can overheat and melt.

00:38

This is what drives the design of this building. If this happens, all the steam is captured

00:43

in this building.


 If you lose pressure, you lose your

00:54

water, and soon your fuel will melt down and release the radioactive fission products within

00:57

it.

00:58

So they have a series of emergency systems designed to always keep the core covered with

01:03

water. We saw the failure of this at Fukushima Daiichi. They had multiple backup diesel generators,

01:08

and each one probably had a very high probability of turning on. The tsunami came and knocked

01:13

them all out."

"California to cover canal with solar panels in experiment to fight drought, climate change",
,Excellent location for solar
,"India has proven this out for many years.

Credit where it's due, the experiment was done by non Americans"
,I feel like it would be smarter to not build cities in deserts
,"good idea, next step ban the almonds, they are bad for you anyway!"
,Based.
,This was my college capstone project. Bastards stole my idea.
,"I previously recommended placing solar panels on the Colorado river south facing mountain sides replacing trees as a way to increase winter/spring runoff not absorbed by trees, and so total river flow southward.

Trees are apparently sacred, but putting solar over the river would accomplish the same or initial benefits."
,"I sort of worry that this might have ramifications down the line.. since the water is not evaporating, it won't go back into underground reservoirs and they will simply drain faster. Is there anything against this?"
,It doesn’t make sense economically.  There are much cheaper ways to prevent canal evaporation and much cheaper locations to build solar.
,"Its just as dumb, there."
,"You can, just doesn't make sense for outdoor gardens and lawns."
,"eeeh its not ideal but people have been living in deserts for thousands and thousands of years. It's not impossible it's just difficult. That said, what is today's desert is tomorrows unlivable desert, so I guess that is worth pointing out."
,Most of the water usage is by farms.
,"While I know almonds are terrible for the amount of water needed, how are they bad for you?"
,Most water evaporates from the oceans (70% of the world’s surface).  Fresh water sources (on land) are trivial compared to this.
,"It is cheap to put solar over canals/rivers because the land rights are ""free"" public/previously authorized lands.  Even if utilities owned river/canal land, any extra use that increases their water benefits is a benefit to them that allows them to offer solar rights for free, or even to pay a small amount for use.  When wire access to send power to consumers is also free, then such projects become super cheap even if construction is a little more awkward than flat cleared land."
,Why?
,[deleted]
,"Most of the calories are fat, high in omega 6 and inflammatory, the protein is not very bioavailable, they are high in oxalates why can cause pain and kidney stones, they are high in phytates which can bind to minerals and inhibit absorbtion"
,"Land acquisition is typically less than 1% of the cost of a solar power installation, e.g., see Figure 30 of …

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/77324.pdf#page59

Like solar roads, floating solar power makes no economic sense."
,"> There are much cheaper ways to prevent canal evaporation and much cheaper locations to build solar.

For example, anti-evaporation film is cheaper than floating solar panels and land-based solar panels are cheaper to install and maintain than floating solar panels."
,Don't they also have cyanide? Or is that an old wives tale?
,"land acquisition is 3 cents per watt. total costs are 77 cents per watt.  So it is 4%, not 1%"
,"They are not floating.  What do you mean bin ""anti-evaporation film"". I did a search and I can't find such a thing being applied to canals.  For the cost of the land in California, and ecological sensitivity of some of the ecosystems, it can make sense to put these on canals."
,Mmmm cyanide 🤤
,"According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit, yes indeed - Almonds have cyanide in them.

So, if I have to choose between almonds or cocoa beans being removed from the economy, I'll choose almonds being removed."
,Smell the same.
,"Figure 30 has 100 MW installations at 0.94 per Watt (fixed axis) and land acquisition doesn’t even rate representation in the cost bar, so it is definitely less than 1%.  Perhaps you’ve seen a different study?"
,"There are lots of ways to reduce water lost to evaporation.  Solar panel covers are the most expensive …

,"Cyanide CN, carbon dioxide CO2. We can refer to both of them as carbon."
,There was a study with a compound in both coffee and cocoa that it depletes calcium magnesium molybdium and others. And that would consuming less than 800mg of calcium were getting bone loss from coffee
